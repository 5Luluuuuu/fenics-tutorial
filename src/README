This file tree contains examples programs from the FEniCS Tutorial by
H. P. Langtangen.

File paths reflect the nature of the PDE problem being solved. For
example, stationary/poisson/d2_p2D.py has a descriptive directory
path and a very brief Unix-style filename. The latter indicates a
second Dirichlet problem example (d2), with a brief postfix p2D
which here is meant to identify a 2D Poisson problem and help to
provide a unique filename among all the programs.  Quite similarly,
transient/diffusion/sin_daD.py is the file associated with a
transient diffusion PDE, with sin as an identifier for a sinusoidal
boundary condition in time and daD as an identifier for a diffusion
problem (d) where the code works in any dimension (aD), i.e., 1D,
2D, or 3D. We will occasionally only make references to the basename
of a previously introduced filename, say d2_p2D.py, instead of the
much longer complete name stationary/poisson/d2_p2D.py.
