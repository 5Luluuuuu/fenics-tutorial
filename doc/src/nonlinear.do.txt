======= Nonlinear problems =======
label{tut:poisson:nonlinear}

Now we shall address how to solve nonlinear PDEs in FEniCS. Our
sample PDE for implementation is taken as a nonlinear Poisson equation:

!bt
\begin{equation}
-\nabla\cdot\left( q(u)\nabla u\right) = f\tp
\end{equation}
!et
The coefficient $q(u)$ makes the equation nonlinear (unless $q(u)$
is constant in $u$).

To be able to easily verify our implementation,
we choose the domain, $q(u)$, $f$, and the boundary
conditions such that we have
a simple, exact solution $u$. Let
$\Omega$ be the unit hypercube $[0, 1]^d$
in $d$ dimensions, $q(u)=(1+u)^m$, $f=0$, $u=0$ for $x_0=0$, $u=1$
for $x_0=1$, and $\partial u/\partial n=0$ at all other boundaries
$x_i=0$ and $x_i=1$, $i=1,\ldots,d-1$. The coordinates are now represented by
the symbols $x_0,\ldots,x_{d-1}$. The exact solution is then

!bt
\begin{equation}
u(x_0,\ldots,x_d) = \left((2^{m+1}-1)x_0 + 1\right)^{1/(m+1)} - 1\tp
\end{equation}
!et
We refer to Section ref{tut:poisson:nD} for details on formulating a PDE
problem in $d$ space dimensions.

The variational formulation of our model problem reads:
Find $u \in V$ such that

!bt
\begin{equation} label{tut:poisson:nonlinear1}
  F(u; v) = 0 \quad \forall v \in \hat{V},
\end{equation}
!et
where

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{tut:poisson:nonlinear2}
F(u; v) = \int_\Omega q(u)\nabla u\cdot \nabla v \dx,
\end{equation}
!et
and

!bt
\begin{align*}
    \hat{V} &= \{v \in H^1(\Omega) : v = 0 \mbox{ on } x_0=0\mbox{ and }x_0=1\}, \\
     V      &= \{v \in H^1(\Omega) : v = 0 \mbox{ on } x_0=0\mbox{ and } v = 1\mbox{ on }x_0=1\}\tp
\end{align*}
!et
The discrete problem arises as usual by restricting $V$ and $\hat V$ to a
pair of discrete spaces. As usual, we omit any subscript on discrete
spaces and simply say $V$ and $\hat V$ are chosen finite dimensional
according to some mesh with some element type.
Similarly, we let $u$ be the discrete solution and use $\uex$ for
the exact solution if it becomes necessary to distinguish between the two.

The discrete nonlinear problem is then wirtten as: find $u\in V$ such that

!bt
\begin{equation}
  F(u; v) = 0 \quad \forall v \in \hat{V},
label{tut:poisson:nonlinear:d}
\end{equation}
!et
with $u = \sum_{j=1}^N U_j \phi_j$. Since $F$ is a nonlinear function
of $u$, the variational statement gives rise to a system of
nonlinear algebraic equations.

FEniCS can be used in alternative ways for solving a nonlinear PDE
problem. We shall in the following subsections go through four
solution strategies:

  o a simple Picard-type iteration,
  o a Newton method at the algebraic level,
  o a Newton method at the PDE level, and
  o an automatic approach where FEniCS attacks the nonlinear variational
    problem directly.

The "black box" strategy 4 is definitely the simplest one from a
programmer's point of view, but the others give more manual control of
the solution process for nonlinear equations (which also has some
pedagogical advantages, especially for newcomers to nonlinear finite
element problems).

===== Picard iteration =====
label{tut:nonlinear:Picard}
idx{Picard iteration}
idx{successive substitutions}

Picard iteration is an easy way of handling nonlinear PDEs: we simply
use a known, previous solution in the nonlinear terms so that these
terms become linear in the unknown $u$. The strategy is also known as
the method of successive substitutions.
For our particular problem,
we use a known, previous solution in the coefficient $q(u)$.
More precisely, given a solution $u^k$ from iteration $k$, we seek a
new (hopefully improved) solution $u^{k+1}$ in iteration $k+1$ such
that $u^{k+1}$ solves the *linear problem*,

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{tut:poisson:nonlinear:picard1}
\nabla\cdot \left(q(u^k)\nabla u^{k+1}\right) = 0,\quad k=0,1,\ldots
\end{equation}
!et
The iterations require an initial guess $u^0$.
The hope is that $u^{k} \rightarrow u$ as $k\rightarrow\infty$, and that
$u^{k+1}$ is sufficiently close to the exact
solution $u$ of the discrete problem after just a few iterations.

We can easily formulate a variational problem for $u^{k+1}$ from
(ref{tut:poisson:nonlinear:picard1}).
Equivalently, we can approximate $q(u)$ by $q(u^k)$ in
(ref{tut:poisson:nonlinear2})
to obtain the same linear variational problem.
In both cases, the problem consists of seeking
$u^{k+1} \in V$ such that

!bt
\begin{equation} label{tut:poisson:nonlinear:picard2}
  \tilde F(u^{k+1}; v) = 0 \quad \forall v \in \hat{V},\quad k=0,1,\ldots,
\end{equation}
!et
with

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{tut:poisson:nonlinear:picard3}
\tilde F(u^{k+1}; v) = \int_\Omega q(u^k)\nabla u^{k+1}\cdot \nabla v \dx
\tp
\end{equation}
!et
Since this is a linear problem in the unknown $u^{k+1}$, we can equivalently
use the formulation

!bt
\begin{equation}
a(u^{k+1},v) = L(v),
\end{equation}
!et
with

!bt
\begin{align}
a(u,v) &= \int_\Omega q(u^k)\nabla u\cdot \nabla v \dx
\\
L(v) &= 0\tp
\end{align}
!et


The iterations can be stopped when $\epsilon\equiv ||u^{k+1}-u^k||
< \mbox{tol}$, where $\mbox{tol}$ is a small tolerance, say $10^{-5}$, or
when the number of iterations exceed some critical limit. The latter
case will pick up divergence of the method or unacceptable slow
convergence.

idx{`picard_np.py`}

In the solution algorithm we only need to store $u^k$ and $u^{k+1}$,
called `u_k` and `u` in the code below.
The algorithm can then be expressed as follows:

!bc pycod
def q(u):
    return (1+u)**m

# Define variational problem for Picard iteration
u = TrialFunction(V)
v = TestFunction(V)
u_k = interpolate(Constant(0.0), V)  # previous (known) u
a = inner(q(u_k)*nabla_grad(u), nabla_grad(v))*dx
f = Constant(0.0)
L = f*v*dx

# Picard iterations
u = Function(V)     # new unknown function
eps = 1.0           # error measure ||u-u_k||
tol = 1.0E-5        # tolerance
iter = 0            # iteration counter
maxiter = 25        # max no of iterations allowed
while eps > tol and iter < maxiter:
    iter += 1
    solve(a == L, u, bcs)
    diff = u.vector().array() - u_k.vector().array()
    eps = numpy.linalg.norm(diff, ord=numpy.Inf)
    print 'iter=%d: norm=%g' % (iter, eps)
    u_k.assign(u)   # update for next iteration
!ec
We need to define the previous solution in the iterations, `u_k`,
as a finite element function so that `u_k` can be updated with
`u` at the end of the loop. We may create the initial
`Function u_k`
by interpolating
an `Expression` or a `Constant`
to the same vector space as `u` lives in (`V`).

In the code above we demonstrate how to use
`numpy` functionality to compute the norm of
the difference between the two most recent solutions. Here we apply
the maximum norm ($\ell_\infty$ norm) on the difference of the solution vectors
(`ord=1` and `ord=2` give the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ vector
norms - other norms are possible for `numpy` arrays,
see `pydoc numpy.linalg.norm`).

The file `picard_np.py` contains the complete code for
this nonlinear Poisson problem.
The implementation is $d$ dimensional, with mesh
construction and setting of Dirichlet conditions as explained in
Section ref{tut:poisson:nD}.
For a $33\times 33$ grid with $m=2$ we need 9 iterations for convergence
when the tolerance is $10^{-5}$.

===== A Newton method at the algebraic level =====
label{tut:nonlinear:Newton:algebraic}
idx{Newton's method (algebraic equations)}

After having discretized our nonlinear PDE problem, we may
use Newton's method to solve the system of nonlinear algebraic equations.
From the continuous variational problem (ref{tut:poisson:nonlinear1}),
the discrete version (ref{tut:poisson:nonlinear:d}) results in a
system of equations for the unknown parameters $U_1,\ldots, U_N$
(by inserting $u = \sum_{j=1}^N U_j \phi_j$
and $v=\hat\phi_i$ in (ref{tut:poisson:nonlinear:d})):

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{tut:nonlinear:Newton:F1}
F_i(U_1,\ldots,U_N) \equiv
\sum_{j=1}^N
\int_\Omega \left( q\left(\sum_{\ell=1}^NU_\ell\phi_\ell\right)
\nabla \phi_j U_j\right)\cdot \nabla \hat\phi_i \dx = 0,\quad i=1,\ldots,N\tp
\end{equation}
!et
Newton's method for the system $F_i(U_1,\ldots,U_j)=0$, $i=1,\ldots,N$
can be formulated as

!bt
\begin{align}
\sum_{j=1}^N
{\partial \over\partial U_j} F_i(U_1^k,\ldots,U_N^k)\delta U_j
&= -F_i(U_1^k,\ldots,U_N^k),\quad i=1,\ldots,N,\\
U_j^{k+1} &= U_j^k + \omega\delta U_j,\quad j=1,\ldots,N,
\end{align}
!et
where $\omega\in [0,1]$ is a relaxation parameter, and $k$ is
an iteration index. An initial guess $u^0$ must
be provided to start the algorithm.

idx{under-relaxation}
The original Newton method has $\omega=1$, but in problems where it is
difficult to obtain convergence,
so-called *under-relaxation* with $\omega < 1$ may help. It means that
one takes a smaller step than what is suggested by Newton's method.

idx{Jacobian, manual computation}

We need, in a program, to compute the Jacobian
matrix $\partial F_i/\partial U_j$
and the right-hand side vector $-F_i$.
Our present problem has $F_i$ given by (ref{tut:nonlinear:Newton:F1}).
The derivative $\partial F_i/\partial U_j$ becomes

!bt
\begin{equation}
\int\limits_\Omega \left\lbrack
 q'(\sum_{\ell=1}^NU_\ell^k\phi_\ell)\phi_j
\nabla (\sum_{j=1}^NU_j^k\phi_j)\cdot \nabla \hat\phi_i
+
q\left(\sum_{\ell=1}^NU_\ell^k\phi_\ell\right)
\nabla \phi_j \cdot \nabla \hat\phi_i
\right\rbrack
 \dx\tp
label{tut:poisson:nonlinear:dFdU}
\end{equation}
!et
The following results were used to obtain (ref{tut:poisson:nonlinear:dFdU}):

!bt
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial U_j} = {\partial\over\partial U_j}
\sum_{j=1}^NU_j\phi_j = \phi_j,\quad {\partial\over\partial U_j}\nabla u = \nabla\phi_j,\quad {\partial\over\partial U_j}q(u) = q'(u)\phi_j\tp
\end{equation}
!et
We can reformulate the Jacobian matrix
in (ref{tut:poisson:nonlinear:dFdU})
by introducing the short
notation $u^k = \sum_{j=1}^NU_j^k\phi_j$:

!bt
\begin{equation}
{\partial F_i\over\partial U_j} =
\int_\Omega \left\lbrack
q'(u^k)\phi_j
\nabla u^k \cdot \nabla \hat\phi_i
+
q(u^k)
\nabla \phi_j \cdot \nabla \hat\phi_i
\right\rbrack \dx\tp
\end{equation}
!et
In order to make FEniCS compute this matrix, we need to formulate a
corresponding variational problem. Looking at the
linear system of equations in Newton's method,

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{j=1}^N {\partial F_i\over\partial U_j}\delta U_j = -F_i,\quad
i=1,\ldots,N,
\end{equation*}
!et
we can introduce $v$ as a general test function replacing $\hat\phi_i$,
and we can identify the unknown
$\delta u = \sum_{j=1}^N\delta U_j\phi_j$. From the linear system
we can now go "backwards" to construct the corresponding linear
discrete weak form to be solved in each Newton iteration:

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{tut:nonlinear:Newton:aLF}
\int_\Omega \left\lbrack
q'(u^k)\delta u
\nabla u^k \cdot \nabla v
+
q(u^k)
\nabla \delta u\cdot \nabla v
\right\rbrack \dx = - \int_\Omega q(u^k)
\nabla u^k\cdot \nabla v \dx\tp
\end{equation}
!et
This variational form fits the standard notation
$a(\delta u,v)=L(v)$ with

!bt
\begin{align*}
a(\delta u,v) &=
\int_\Omega \left\lbrack
q'(u^k)\delta u
\nabla u^k \cdot \nabla v
+
q(u^k)
\nabla \delta u \cdot \nabla v
\right\rbrack
 \dx\\
L(v) &= - \int_\Omega q(u^k)
\nabla u^k\cdot \nabla v \dx\tp
\end{align*}
!et
Note the important feature in Newton's method
that the
previous solution $u^k$ replaces $u$
in the formulas when computing the matrix
$\partial F_i/\partial U_j$ and vector $F_i$ for the linear system in
each Newton iteration.

idx{`alg_newton_np.py`}

We now turn to the implementation.
To obtain a good initial guess $u^0$, we can solve a simplified, linear
problem, typically with $q(u)=1$, which yields the standard Laplace
equation $\nabla^2 u^0 =0$. The recipe for solving this problem
appears in Sections ref{tut:poisson1:varform},
ref{tut:poisson1:impl}, and ref{tut:poisson1:DN}.
The code for computing $u^0$ becomes as follows:

!bc pycod
tol = 1E-14
def left_boundary(x, on_boundary):
    return on_boundary and abs(x[0]) < tol

def right_boundary(x, on_boundary):
    return on_boundary and abs(x[0]-1) < tol

Gamma_0 = DirichletBC(V, Constant(0.0), left_boundary)
Gamma_1 = DirichletBC(V, Constant(1.0), right_boundary)
bcs = [Gamma_0, Gamma_1]

# Define variational problem for initial guess (q(u)=1, i.e., m=0)
u = TrialFunction(V)
v = TestFunction(V)
a = inner(nabla_grad(u), nabla_grad(v))*dx
f = Constant(0.0)
L = f*v*dx
A, b = assemble_system(a, L, bcs)
u_k = Function(V)
U_k = u_k.vector()
solve(A, U_k, b)
!ec
Here, `u_k` denotes the solution function for the previous
iteration, so that the solution
after each Newton iteration is `u = u_k + omega*du`.
Initially, `u_k` is the initial guess we call $u^0$ in the mathematics.


The Dirichlet boundary conditions for $\delta u$, in
the problem to be solved in each Newton
iteration, are somewhat different than the conditions for $u$.
Assuming that $u^k$ fulfills the
Dirichlet conditions for $u$, $\delta u$ must be zero at the boundaries
where the Dirichlet conditions apply, in order for $u^{k+1}=u^k + \omega\delta u$ to fulfill
the right boundary values. We therefore define an additional list of
Dirichlet boundary conditions objects for $\delta u$:

!bc pycod
Gamma_0_du = DirichletBC(V, Constant(0), left_boundary)
Gamma_1_du = DirichletBC(V, Constant(0), right_boundary)
bcs_du = [Gamma_0_du, Gamma_1_du]
!ec
The nonlinear coefficient and its derivative must be defined
before coding the weak form of the Newton system:

!bc pycod
def q(u):
    return (1+u)**m

def Dq(u):
    return m*(1+u)**(m-1)

du = TrialFunction(V) # u = u_k + omega*du
a = inner(q(u_k)*nabla_grad(du), nabla_grad(v))*dx + \
    inner(Dq(u_k)*du*nabla_grad(u_k), nabla_grad(v))*dx
L = -inner(q(u_k)*nabla_grad(u_k), nabla_grad(v))*dx
!ec

The Newton iteration loop is very similar to the Picard iteration loop
in Section ref{tut:nonlinear:Picard}:

!bc pycod
du = Function(V)
u  = Function(V)  # u = u_k + omega*du
omega = 1.0       # relaxation parameter
eps = 1.0
tol = 1.0E-5
iter = 0
maxiter = 25
while eps > tol and iter < maxiter:
    iter += 1
    A, b = assemble_system(a, L, bcs_du)
    solve(A, du.vector(), b)
    eps = numpy.linalg.norm(du.vector().array(), ord=numpy.Inf)
    print 'Norm:', eps
    u.vector()[:] = u_k.vector() + omega*du.vector()
    u_k.assign(u)
!ec
There are other ways of implementing the
update of the solution as well:

!bc pycod
u.assign(u_k)  # u = u_k
u.vector().axpy(omega, du.vector())

# or
u.vector()[:] += omega*du.vector()
!ec
The `axpy(a, y)` operation adds a scalar `a` times a `Vector`
`y` to a `Vector` object.  It is usually a fast operation
calling up an optimized BLAS routine for the calculation.

Mesh construction for a $d$-dimensional problem with arbitrary degree of
the Lagrange elements can be done as
explained in Section ref{tut:poisson:nD}.
The complete program appears in the file `alg_newton_np.py`.


===== A Newton method at the PDE level =====
label{tut:nonlinear:Newton:pdelevel}
idx{Newton's method (PDE level)}

Although Newton's method in PDE problems is normally formulated at the
linear algebra level, i.e., as a solution method for systems of nonlinear
algebraic equations, we can also formulate the method at the PDE level.
This approach yields a linearization of the PDEs before they are discretized.
FEniCS users will probably find this technique simpler to apply than
the more standard method in Section ref{tut:nonlinear:Newton:algebraic}.

Given an approximation to the solution field, $u^k$, we seek a
perturbation $\delta u$ so that

!bt
\begin{equation}
u^{k+1} = u^k + \delta u
\end{equation}
!et
fulfills the nonlinear PDE.
However, the problem for $\delta u$ is still nonlinear and nothing is
gained. The idea is therefore to assume that $\delta u$ is sufficiently
small so that we can linearize the problem with respect to $\delta u$.
Inserting $u^{k+1}$ in the PDE,
linearizing the $q$ term as

!bt
\begin{equation}
q(u^{k+1}) = q(u^k) + q'(u^k)\delta u + {\cal O}((\delta u)^2)
\approx q(u^k) + q'(u^k)\delta u,
\end{equation}
!et
and dropping nonlinear terms in $\delta u$,
we get

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\nabla\cdot\left( q(u^k)\nabla u^k\right) +
\nabla\cdot\left( q(u^k)\nabla\delta u\right) +
\nabla\cdot\left( q'(u^k)\delta u\nabla u^k\right) = 0\tp
\end{equation*}
!et
We may collect the terms with the unknown $\delta u$ on the left-hand side,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot\left( q(u^k)\nabla\delta u\right) +
\nabla\cdot\left( q'(u^k)\delta u\nabla u^k\right) =
-\nabla\cdot\left( q(u^k)\nabla u^k\right),
\end{equation}
!et
The weak form of this PDE is derived by multiplying by a test function $v$
and integrating over $\Omega$, integrating as usual
the second-order derivatives by parts:

!bt
\begin{equation}
\int_\Omega \left(
q(u^k)\nabla\delta u\cdot \nabla v
+ q'(u^k)\delta u\nabla u^k\cdot \nabla v\right) \dx
= -\int_\Omega q(u^k)\nabla u^k\cdot \nabla v \dx\tp
\end{equation}
!et
The variational problem reads: find $\delta u\in V$ such that
$a(\delta u,v) = L(v)$ for all $v\in \hat V$, where

!bt
\begin{align}
a(\delta u,v) &=
\int_\Omega \left(
q(u^k)\nabla\delta u\cdot \nabla v
+ q'(u^k)\delta u\nabla u^k\cdot \nabla v\right) \dx,
label{tut:nonlinear:poisson:pdelevel:eqa}\\
L(v) &= -
\int_\Omega q(u^k)\nabla u^k\cdot \nabla v \dx\tp
label{tut:nonlinear:poisson:pdelevel:eqL}
\end{align}
!et
The function spaces $V$ and $\hat V$, being continuous or discrete,
are as in the
linear Poisson problem from Section ref{tut:poisson1:varform}.

We must provide some initial guess, e.g., the solution of the
PDE with $q(u)=1$. The corresponding weak form $a_0(u^0,v)=L_0(v)$
has

!bt
\begin{equation*}
a_0(u,v)=\int_\Omega\nabla u\cdot \nabla v \dx,\quad L_0(v)=0\tp
\end{equation*}
!et
Thereafter, we enter a loop and solve
$a(\delta u,v)=L(v)$ for $\delta u$ and compute a new approximation
$u^{k+1} = u^k + \delta u$. Note that $\delta u$ is a correction, so if
$u^0$ satisfies the prescribed
Dirichlet conditions on some part $\Gamma_D$ of the boundary,
we must demand $\delta u=0$ on $\Gamma_D$.

Looking at (ref{tut:nonlinear:poisson:pdelevel:eqa}) and
(ref{tut:nonlinear:poisson:pdelevel:eqL}),
we see that the variational form is the same as for the Newton method
at the algebraic level in Section
ref{tut:nonlinear:Newton:algebraic}. Since Newton's method at the
algebraic level required some "backward" construction of the
underlying weak forms, FEniCS users may prefer Newton's method at the
PDE level, which this author finds more straightforward, although not so
commonly documented in the literature on numerical methods for PDEs.
There is seemingly no need for differentiations to derive a Jacobian
matrix, but a mathematically equivalent derivation is done when
nonlinear terms are linearized using the first two Taylor series terms
and when products in the perturbation $\delta u$ are neglected.

idx{`pde_newton_np.py`}

The implementation is identical to the one in
Section ref{tut:nonlinear:Newton:algebraic} and is found in
the file `pde_newton_np.py`. The reader is encouraged to go
through this code to be convinced that the present method actually
ends up with the same program as needed for the Newton method at
the linear algebra level in Section ref{tut:nonlinear:Newton:algebraic}.


===== Solving the nonlinear variational problem directly =====
label{tut:nonlinear:Newton:auto}

idx{`vp1_np.py`}
idx{`vp2_np.py`}

The previous hand-calculations and manual implementation of
Picard or Newton methods can be automated by tools in FEniCS.
In a nutshell, one can just write

!bc pycod
problem = NonlinearVariationalProblem(F, u, bcs, J)
solver  = NonlinearVariationalSolver(problem)
solver.solve()
!ec
where `F` corresponds to the nonlinear form $F(u;v)$,
`u` is the unknown `Function` object, `bcs`
represents the essential boundary conditions (in general a list of
`DirichletBC` objects), and
`J` is a variational form for the Jacobian of `F`.

Let us explain in detail how to use the built-in tools for
nonlinear variational problems and their solution.
The `F` form corresponding to (ref{tut:poisson:nonlinear2})
is straightforwardly defined as follows, assuming `q(u)` is
coded as a Python function:

!bc pycod
u_ = Function(V)     # most recently computed solution
v  = TestFunction(V)
F  = inner(q(u_)*nabla_grad(u_), nabla_grad(v))*dx
!ec
Note here that `u_` is a `Function` (not a `TrialFunction`).
An alternative and perhaps more intuitive formula for $F$ is to
define $F(u;v)$ directly in terms of
a trial function for $u$ and a test function for $v$, and then
create the proper `F` by

!bc pycod
u  = TrialFunction(V)
v  = TestFunction(V)
F  = inner(q(u)*nabla_grad(u), nabla_grad(v))*dx
u_ = Function(V)     # the most recently computed solution
F  = action(F, u_)
!ec
The latter statement is equivalent to $F(u=u_{-}; v)$, where $u_{-}$ is
an existing finite element function representing the most recently
computed approximation to the solution.
(Note that $u^k$ and $u^{k+1}$ in the previous notation
correspond to $u_{-}$ and $u$ in the present
notation. We have changed notation to better align the mathematics with
the associated UFL code.)

idx{Gateaux derivative}

The derivative $J$ (`J`) of $F$ (`F`) is formally the
Gateaux derivative $DF(u^k; \delta u, v)$
of $F(u;v)$ at $u=u_{-}$ in the direction of $\delta u$.
Technically, this Gateaux derivative is derived by computing

!bt
\begin{equation}
\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0}{d\over d\epsilon} F_i(u_{-} + \epsilon\delta u; v)
\tp  label{tut:poisson:nonlinear:Gateaux1}
\end{equation}
!et
The $\delta u$ is now the trial function and $u_{-}$ is the previous
approximation to the solution $u$.
We start with

!bt
\begin{equation*}
{d\over d\epsilon}\int_\Omega \nabla v\cdot\left( q(u_{-} + \epsilon\delta u)
\nabla (u_{-} + \epsilon\delta u)\right) \dx
\end{equation*}
!et
and obtain

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\int_\Omega \nabla v\cdot\left\lbrack
q'(u_{-} + \epsilon\delta u)\delta u
\nabla (u_{-} + \epsilon\delta u)
+
q(u_{-} + \epsilon\delta u)
\nabla \delta u
\right\rbrack \dx,
\end{equation*}
!et
which leads to

!bt
\begin{equation}
\int_\Omega \nabla v\cdot\left\lbrack
q'(u_{-})\delta u
\nabla (u_{-})
+
q(u_{-})
\nabla \delta u
\right\rbrack \dx,
\end{equation}
!et
as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$.
This last expression is the Gateaux derivative of $F$. We may use $J$ or
$a(\delta u, v)$ for this derivative, the latter having the advantage
that we easily recognize the expression as a bilinear form. However, in
the forthcoming code examples `J` is used as variable name for
the Jacobian.

The specification of `J`
goes as follows if `du` is the `TrialFunction`:

!bc pycod
du = TrialFunction(V)
v  = TestFunction(V)
u_ = Function(V)      # the most recently computed solution
F  = inner(q(u_)*nabla_grad(u_), nabla_grad(v))*dx

J = inner(q(u_)*nabla_grad(du), nabla_grad(v))*dx + \
    inner(Dq(u_)*du*nabla_grad(u_), nabla_grad(v))*dx
!ec
The alternative specification of `F`, with `u` as
`TrialFunction`, leads to

!bc pycod
u  = TrialFunction(V)
v  = TestFunction(V)
u_ = Function(V)      # the most recently computed solution
F  = inner(q(u)*nabla_grad(u), nabla_grad(v))*dx
F  = action(F, u_)

J = inner(q(u_)*nabla_grad(u), nabla_grad(v))*dx + \
    inner(Dq(u_)*u*nabla_grad(u_), nabla_grad(v))*dx
!ec

idx{automatic differentiation}

The UFL language, used to specify weak forms, supports differentiation
of forms. This feature facilitates automatic *symbolic* computation of the
Jacobian `J` by calling the function `derivative` with `F`, the most
recently computed solution (`Function`), and the unknown
(`TrialFunction`) as parameters:

!bc pycod
du = TrialFunction(V)
v  = TestFunction(V)
u_ = Function(V)      # the most recently computed solution
F  = inner(q(u_)*nabla_grad(u_), nabla_grad(v))*dx

J  = derivative(F, u_, du)  # Gateaux derivative in dir. of du
!ec
or

!bc pycod
u  = TrialFunction(V)
v  = TestFunction(V)
u_ = Function(V)      # the most recently computed solution
F  = inner(q(u)*nabla_grad(u), nabla_grad(v))*dx
F  = action(F, u_)

J  = derivative(F, u_, u)   # Gateaux derivative in dir. of u
!ec
The `derivative` function is obviously
very convenient in problems where differentiating `F` by hand
implies lengthy calculations.

The preferred implementation of `F` and `J`, depending on whether
`du` or `u` is the `TrialFunction` object,
is a matter of personal taste. Derivation of the Gateaux derivative
by hand, as shown above, is most naturally matched by an
implementation where `du` is the `TrialFunction`, while
use of automatic symbolic differentiation with the aid of the `derivative`
function is most naturally matched by an implementation where
`u` is the `TrialFunction`.
We have implemented both approaches in two files:
`vp1_np.py` with
`u` as `TrialFunction`, and
`vp2_np.py` with `du` as `TrialFunction`.
The directory
`stationary/nonlinear_poisson` contains both files.
The first command-line argument determines if the Jacobian is to
be automatically derived or computed from the hand-derived formula.

The following code defines the nonlinear variational problem and
an associated solver based on Newton's method. We here demonstrate
how key parameters in
Newton's method can be set, as well as the choice of
solver and preconditioner, and associated parameters, for the
linear system occurring in the Newton iteration.

!bc pycod

A list of available parameters and their default values can as
usual be printed by calling `info(prm, True)`.
The `u_` we feed to the nonlinear variational problem object
is filled with the solution by the call `solver.solve()`.
