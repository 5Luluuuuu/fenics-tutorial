======= Class design of solvers =======

Small ``flat'' programs where statements related to problem definition
and to the numerical solution procedure are wired together are well
suited as demos and as a way to try out things. However, for more
serious research work we propose to make a clear distinction between
the general PDE solver code and the specific problem to be solved and
its physical data.

More precisely, we propose to collect all code related to a
PDE solver in a class `Solver` and all problem-dependent code
in a class `Problem`. Let us use the membrane solver from
Section ref{tut:poisson:membrane} to illustrate this idea.
The basic code is found in the file `membrane1.py`.
We also want an additional computation of
the elastic energy $\half||T\nabla w||^2$ as outlined in
Section ref{tut:poisson1:functionals}. That means membrane2???
