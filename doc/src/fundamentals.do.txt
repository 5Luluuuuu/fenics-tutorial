The goal of this chapter is to show how a range of important PDEs
from science and engineering can be quickly solved with a few lines
of FEniCS code. We introduce the most
fundamental FEniCS objects such as `Mesh`, `Function`,
`FunctionSpace`, `TrialFunction`,
and `TestFunction`, and learn how to set up the variational formulation
of the PDE problem in a way that closely resembles the mathematics.

The code is made as simple as possible, we solve all linear systems
by (sparse) Gaussian elimination, we don't use any problem-dependent
optimizations of algorithms and code, and we only treat examples taking
place in homogeneous media. Subsequent chapters will extend the
examples here with more general, efficient, and sophisticated
implementations.
