The goal of this chapter is to show how a range of important PDEs
from science and engineering can be quickly solved with a few lines
of FEniCS code. We start with the time-dependent diffusion equation
and continue with a nonlinear Poisson equation, the vector PDE for
linear elasticity, and the Navier-Stokes equations.

We derive the variational formulation and put
together basic objects such as `Mesh`, `Function`,
`FunctionSpace`, `TrialFunction`,
and `TestFunction` to express in variational formulation in Python code
in a way that closely resembles the mathematics.
