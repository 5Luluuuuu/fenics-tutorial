The goal of this chapter is to demonstrate how a range of important PDEs
from science and engineering can be quickly solved with a few lines of
FEniCS code. We start with the heat equation and continue with a
nonlinear Poisson equation, the equations for linear elasticity, and
the Navier-Stokes equations. These problems illustrate how to solve
time-dependent problems, nonlinear problems, vector-valued problems,
and systems of PDE. For each problem, we derive the variational
formulation and express the problem in Python in a way that closely
resembles the mathematics.

[AL: We say "systems of PDE" but we use a splitting method. We have
not really taked about systems (using mixed function spaces).]
