======= The Navier--Stokes equations =======

As our final example in this chapter, we will solve the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations. This problem combines many of the challenges
from our previously studied problems: time-dependence, nonlinearity,
and vector-valued variables.

===== Variational formulation =====

The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are a system of equations
for the velocity $u$ and pressure $p$ in an incompressible fluid:

!bt
\begin{align}
  \dot{u} + u \cdot \nabla u - \nu \Delta u + \nabla p &= f, \\
  \nabla \cdot u &= 0.
\end{align}

  \langle (u_h^{\star} - u_h^{n-1}) / \Delta t_n, v \rangle +
  \langle \nabla u_h^{n-1} \cdot u_h^{n-1}, v \rangle +
  \langle \nu \nabla u_h^{\star}, \nabla v \rangle =
  \langle f, v \rangle.
\end{align}
