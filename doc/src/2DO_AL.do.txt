======= To-do list =======

===== AL list =====

 * Title?: Writing State-of-the-Art Finite Element Solvers in Minutes
   (HPL: Yes - let's have this for a while)
 * Title?: Introduction to Finite Element Programming
 * Add 2nd author
 * Rewrite abstract to reflect new title and non-initial state of book
 * Rename and expand Chapter 5: Boundary conditions, markers and subdomains
   (many and confusing ways to do this, MeshFunctions, MeshData, etc)
   (HPL: This is important and confusing, but very much needed early on)
 * DONE: Add chapter on installation (difficult, still in flux)
 * Installation chapter should be number 0
 * Remove capitalization of sections in Chapter 8
 * Add new chapter: "Advanced example: Linear elasticity"
   (HPL: do this first - important for many courses)
 * Add new chapter: "Advanced example: Hyperelasticity"
 * Add new chapter: "Advanced example: Incompressible Navier-Stokes"
 * Place these chapters near end of book so progression becomes:
    * Installlation
    * Fundamentals (3 chapters: Fundamentals, Time-dependendent, Nonlinear)
    * Misc technical chapters (boundary conditions, geometries etc)
      (HPL: Think we need these things before time-dependent, or maybe
      split the very simplest things from time-dependent (1st example)
      and nonlinear (`solve(F==0, ...)`) and place in fundamentals?)
    * Advanced examples (using previously discussed techniques)
 * Add chapter on performance and profiling? HPL: Yes!
 * Move source code links to http://fenisproject.org/tutorial (we can
   set up a cronjob to copy files from hplgit)
 * Number examples sequentially, something like
    * `fenics_tutorial_01_poisson_first.py`
    * `fenics_tutorial_05_poisson_nonlinear.py`
   Hierarchic structure becomes complicated, better with flat structure
   (HPL: Agree, let's have just one published src directory, only about
   15 programs so far)
 * Add command fenics-version
 * Use dot and grad in Poisson example (not `inner` and `nabla_grad`)
   (HPL: Not so sure about this...needs discussion as it is easy to make
   mistakes when moving to vector PDEs, think about Poisson vs linear
   elasticity, should not be a big step for nabla operators)
 * Use new notation 'P' instead of 'Lagrange' in FunctionSpace
   (HPL: Not yet documented in `FunctionSpace` ;-)
 * DONE: Use `from fenics import *`
