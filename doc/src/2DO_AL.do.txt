======= To-do list =======

Initial random notes, thoughts and questions by AL during readthrough.

 * Title?: Writing State-of-the-Art Finite Element Solvers in Minutes
 * Title?: Introduction to Finite Element Programming
 * Add 2nd author
 * Rewrite abstract to reflect new title and non-initial state of book
 * Rename and expand Chapter 5: Boundary conditions, markers and subdomains
   (many and confusing ways to do this, MeshFunctions, MeshData, etc)
 * Add chapter on installation (difficult, still in flux)
 * Installation chapter should be number 0
 * Remove capitalization of sections in Chapter 8
 * Add new chapter: "Advanced example: Hyperelasticity"
 * Add new chapter: "Advanced example: Incompressible Navier-Stokes"
 * Place these chapters near end of book so progression becomes:
    - Installlation
    - Fundamentals (3 chapters: Fundamentals, Time-dependendent, Nonlinear)
    - Misc technical chapters (boundary conditions, geometries etc)
    - Advanced examples (using previously discussed techniques)
 * Add chapter on performance and profiling?
 * Move source code links to http://fenisproject.org/tutorial (we can
   set up a cronjob to copy files from hplgit)
 * Number examples sequentially, something like
    - fenics_tutorial_01_poisson_first.py
    - fenics_tutorial_05_poisson_nonlinear.py
   Hierarchic structure becomes complicated, better with flat structure
 * Add command fenics-version
 * Use dot and grad in Poisson example (not inner and nabla_grad)
 * Use new notation 'P' instead of 'Lagrange' in FunctionSpace
 * Use from fenics import *
