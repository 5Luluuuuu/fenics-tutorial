======= To-do list =======

Remember: cannot exceed 150 pages (output from `ftut.log`!).

 * Reorganize sections into chapters. (HPL)
 * Rethink how to organize example programs in directories.
   Find a naming convention. (AL)
 * Programs are now flat demos. Educate the reader with
   better software engineering habits: functions, classes, unit tests.
   Avoid copy-and-edit flat programs implied by today's collection. (HPL)
 * Compute maximum error already in the first example so we can create
   a unit test as early as possible. (HPL)
 * Write about installation in a way that does not get outdated.
   More as a guide to a newcomer: What to choose? (AL)
 * Multi-boundary examples do not work with FEniCS 1.6: `dnr*.py`. (AL)
 * `membrane2.py` referred to, but it is still in sandbox. (HPL)
 * Meshr domains. Set up some common continuum mechanics examples first. (HPL/AL)
 * Decide on an elasticity problem.
 * Simple Navier-Stokes solver. Do backward facing step and flow around a
   cylinder. (AL)

Initial random notes, thoughts and questions by AL during readthrough.

 * Title?: Writing State-of-the-Art Finite Element Solvers in Minutes
 * Title?: Introduction to Finite Element Programming
 * Add 2nd author
 * Rewrite abstract to reflect new title and non-initial state of book
 * Rename and expand Chapter 5: Boundary conditions, markers and subdomains
   (many and confusing ways to do this, MeshFunctions, MeshData, etc)
 * Add chapter on installation (difficult, still in flux)
 * Installation chapter should be number 0
 * Remove capitalization of sections in Chapter 8
 * Add new chapter: "Advanced example: Hyperelasticity"
 * Add new chapter: "Advanced example: Incompressible Navier-Stokes"
 * Place these chapters near end of book so progression becomes:
    - Installlation
    - Fundamentals (3 chapters: Fundamentals, Time-dependendent, Nonlinear)
    - Misc technical chapters (boundary conditions, geometries etc)
    - Advanced examples (using previously discussed techniques)
 * Add chapter on performance and profiling?
