Comments after proofreading August 2016

[ ] I get 'missing citations' and 'missing references' but this may be
    a result of not being able to run 'make final'
[ ] There are still some unfortunate page breaks. I will ignore these
    for now and look at page formatting later.
[ ] Need to add instructions for how to send feedback and report typos
[ ] Think about whether to use http or https i references
[ ] Create web page for book: fenicsproject.org/tutorial
[ ] Check that Docker image stable-py3 is actually available
[ ] Alignment of equations: $x \in \Omega$ using alignat
[ ] How to run spellcheck?
[ ] Regenerate the plot for first Poisson example on 8 x 8 mesh
[ ] Add reference to SIAM News periodic table article in Chapter 1
[x] Inconsistent notation: u_D in math and u_b in code
[ ] Small figures, for example 2.4, with difficult to read text
[ ] Check all Navier--Stokes etc
[ ] Check vtkfile << (u, t) for time-dependent problems
[ ] kappa(x) or q(x) in Section 3.2? Watch out for comment on q in
    sympy code and name clash box.
[ ] Check all 'variational problem: Find' (not 'find')
[ ] Check all eqns (...)--(...)
[ ] Check all 'Save' vs 'Dump' in code examples
[ ] Which equations should be numbered?
[ ] Always use xrange?
[ ] k0 or k_0? Same for Omega0 in subdomains chapter
[ ] Renumber to 0, 1, 2 in NS and reaction examples?
[ ] Rename poisson_vc.py to something less cryptic
[ ] poisson_vc.py is 900 lines long! Does it have to be that complicated?

Codes to check:

poisson.py
membrane.py
heat.py
gaussian_diffusion.py
nlpoisson.py
elasticity.py
navier_stokes_channel.py
navier_stokes_box.py ???
navier_stokes_cylinder.py
reaction_system.py
poisson_vc.py
