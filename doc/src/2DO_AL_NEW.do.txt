Comments after proofreading August 2016

[ ] I get 'missing citations' and 'missing references' but this may be
    a result of not being able to run 'make final'
[ ] There are still some unfortunate page breaks. I will ignore these
    for now and look at page formatting later.
[ ] Need to add instructions for how to send feedback and report typos
