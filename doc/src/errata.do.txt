======= Errata in The Tutorial Chapter in The FEniCS Book =======

 * Section *Controlling the Solution Process*: Only one of the
   stopping criteria for linear solvers needs to be fulfilled. That
   is, the text should read ``Stopping criteria for Krylov solvers
   usually involve the norm of the residual, which must be smaller
   than the absolute tolerance parameter *or* smaller than the
   relative tolerance parameter times the initial residual.''
