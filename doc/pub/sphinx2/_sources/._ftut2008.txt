Compilation Problems
====================

.. index:: compilation problems

Expressions and variational forms in a FEniCS program need to be
compiled to C++ and linked with libraries if the expressions or forms
have been modified since last time they were compiled.  The tool
Instant, which is part of the FEniCS software suite, is used for
compiling and linking C++ code so that it can be used with Python.

Sometimes the compilation fails. You can see from the
series of error messages which statement in the Python program that
led to a compilation problem. Make sure to scroll back and identify
whether the problematic line is associated with an expression,
variational form, or the solve step.

The final line in the output of error messages points to a log file
from the compilation where one can examine the error messages from the
compiler. It is usually the last lines of this log file that are of
interest. Occasionally, the compiler's message can quickly lead to an
understanding of the problem.
A more fruitful approach is normally to examine the below list
of common compilation problems and their remedies.

Problems with the Instant cache
-------------------------------

Instant remembers information about previous compilations and versions
of your program. Sometimes removal of this information can solve
the problem. Just run

.. code-block:: text

    instant-clean

in a terminal window whenever you encounter a compilation problem.

Syntax errors in expressions
----------------------------

If the compilation problem arises from line with an ``Expression``
object, examine the syntax of the expression carefully.  You may also
want to examine the log file, pointed to in the last line in the
output of error messages. The compiler's message about the syntax
problem may lead you to a solution.

Some common problems are

 1. using ``a**b`` for exponentiation (illegal in C++) instead of ``pow(a, b)``,

 2. forgetting that the spatial coordinates are denoted by a vector ``x``,

 3. forgetting that the :math:`x`, :math:`y`, and :math:`z` coordinates in space correspond
    to ``x[0]``, ``x[1]``, and ``x[2]``, respectively.

Failure to initialize parameters in the expressions lead to a
compilation error where this problem is explicitly pointed out.

Example
~~~~~~~

The implementation

.. code-block:: python

    u_exact = Expression(
        'x[1] <= 0.5? 2*x[1]*p_1/(p_0 + p_1) : '
        '((2*x[1]-1)p_0 + p_1)/(p_0 + p_1)',
        p_0=p_values[0], p_1=p_values[1])

fails with compilation error

.. code-block:: text

    RuntimeError: In instant.recompile: The module did not compile with
    command 'make VERBOSE=1', see '/some/path/.../compile.log'

Looking up the ``compile.log`` file and searching for ``error``, we see
the following message from the C++ compiler:

.. code-block:: text

    error: expected ‘)’ before ‘p_0’
       values[0] = x[1] <= 0.5? 2*x[1]*p_1/(p_0 + p_1) :
       ((2*x[1]-1)p_0 + p_1)/(p_0 + p_1);
                  ^

Now we realize that a ``*`` symbol is missing between ``)`` and ``p_0``.

An integral without a domain is now illegal
-------------------------------------------

This error message from UFL (``ufl.log.UFLException``) often points to
a factor in a variational form that is 0. The factor should be
``Constant(0)``.

Problems with SymPy and ``diff`` expressions
--------------------------------------------

If you work with FEniCS and SymPy in the same program, be aware
that ``from fenics import *`` imports a lot of symbols that you also
have in ``sympy``, so you have to do ``import sympy as sym``. However,
it is easy to write something like ``p*diff(u,x)`` meaning differentiation
of the symbolic expression ``u``, but a pure ``diff`` is then the ``diff``
object from ``fenics``, not from ``sympy``. The right statement is
``p*sym.diff(u,x)``. (Error messages arising from this example
can be quite difficult to interpret).

Problems in the solve step
--------------------------

Sometimes the problem lies in the solve step where a variational form
is turned into a system of algebraic equations.
The error message *Unable to extract all indicies* points to a problem with the
variational form. Common errors include

 1. missing either the ``TrialFunction`` or the ``TestFunction`` object,

 2. no terms without ``TrialFunction`` objects.

 3. mathematically invalid operations in the variational form.

The first problem implies that one cannot make a matrix system or
system of nonlinear algebraic equations out of the variational form.
The second problem means that there is no "right-hand side" terms in the PDE
with known quantities. Sometimes this is seemingly the case mathematically
because the "right-hand side" is zero. Variational forms must represent this
case as ``Constant(0)*v*dx`` where ``v`` is a ``TestFunction`` object.
An example of the third problem is to take the ``inner`` product of
a scalar and a vector (causing in this particular case
the error message to be "Shape mismatch").

The message *Unable to extract common cell; missing cell definition in
form or expression* will typically arise from a term in the form where
a test function (holding mesh and cell information) is missing.
For example, a zero right-hand side ``Constant(0)*dx`` will generate
this error.

Unable to convert object to a UFL form
--------------------------------------

One common reason for the above error message is that a form is
written without being multiplied by ``dx`` or ``ds``.

UFL reports that a numpy array cannot be converted to any UFL type
------------------------------------------------------------------

One reason may be that there are mathematical functions like ``sin`` and
``exp`` operating on ``numpy`` arrays. The problem is that
the

.. code-block:: python

    from fenics import *

statement imports
``sin``, ``cos``,
and similar mathematical functions from UFL and these are aimed at
taking ``Function`` or ``TrialFunction``
objects as arguments and not ``numpy`` arrays.
The remedy is to use prefix mathematical functions aimed at
``numpy`` arrays with ``numpy``, or ``np`` if ``numpy`` is imported as ``np``:
``numpy.exp`` or ``np.exp``, for instance.
Normally, boundary conditions and analytical solutions are represented
by ``Expression`` objects and then this problem does not arise.
The problem usually arises when pure Python functions with, e.g., analytical
solutions are introduced for, e.g., plotting.

All programs fail to compile
----------------------------

When encountering a compilation problem where the Instant log file says
something about missing double quote in an ``Expression``, try compiling
a previously working program. If that program faces the same problem,
reboot Ubuntu and try again.  If the problem persists, try running the
Update Manager (because unfinished updates can cause compiler
problems), reboot and try again.

Problems with Expression Objects
================================

There seems to be some bug in an Expression object
--------------------------------------------------

Run the command ``instant-clean`` to ensure that everything is
(re)compiled.  Check the formulas in string expressions carefully, and
make sure that divisions do not lead to integer division (i.e., at
least one of the operands in a division must be a floating-point
variable).

Segmentation fault when using an Expression object
--------------------------------------------------

One reason may be that the point vector ``x`` has indices out of
bounds, e.g., that you access ``x[2]`` but the mesh is only a 2D mesh.
Also recall that the components of ``x`` are ``x[0]``, ``x[1]``, etc.
Accessing ``x[2]``  as the "y" coordinate is a common error.

Other Problems
==============

Very strange error message involving a ``mesh`` variable
--------------------------------------------------------

If you encounter a really strange error message, and the statement
in question involves a variable with name ``mesh``, check if this
is really your mesh variable. When doing ``from fenics import *``, you
get a ``mesh`` variable, which is actually a module, and sending
this module to functions creates a ``TypeError``. Substitute with
the actual name of your mesh object.

One should also note other names that get imported by ``from fenics import *``:
``e``, ``f``, ``i``, ``j``, ``k``, ``l``, ``p``, ``q``, ``r``, ``s``. It is easy to use such
variables without initializing them, and strange error message arises
(since the mentioned names are UFL ``Index`` objects).

The plot disappears quickly from the screen
-------------------------------------------

.. index:: plotting problems

You have forgotten to insert ``interactive()`` as the last statement in
the program.

Only parts of the program are executed
--------------------------------------

Check if a call to ``interactive()`` appears in the middle of the program.
The computations are halted by this call and not continued before
you press ``q`` in a plot window. Most people thus prefer to
have ``interactive()`` as the last statement.

Error in the definition of the boundary
---------------------------------------

Consider this code and error message:

.. code-block:: python

    class DirichletBoundary(SubDomain):  # define the Dirichlet boundary
        def inside(self, x, on_boundary):
            return on_boundary and abs(x) < 1E-14
    
    bc = DirichletBC(V, u0, xleft_boundary)
    
    Error: ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than
    one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

The reason for this error message
is that ``x`` is a point vector, not just a number.
In the ``inside`` function one must work with the
components of ``x``: ``x[0]``, ``x[1]``, etc.

The solver in a nonlinear problems does not converge
----------------------------------------------------

There can be many reasons for this common problem:

 1. The form (variational formulation) is not consistent with the
    PDE(s).

 2. The boundary conditions in a Newton method are wrong. The
    correction vector must have vanishing essential conditions where
    the complete solution has zero or non-zero values.

 3. The initial guess for the solution is not appropriate. In some
    problems, a simple function equal to 0 just leads to a zero
    solution or a divergent solver. Try 1 as initial guess, or
    (better) try to identify a linear problem that can be used to
    compute an appropriate initial guess, see the section :ref:`ftut:nonlinear:Newton:algebraic`.

How To Debug a FEniCS Program?
==============================

.. A true case study with a few bugs would be really helpful here.

.. 1. Linear problem.

.. 2. Nonlinear problem.

.. 3. Time-dependent problem.

.. 4. Time-dependent nonlinear problem.

Here is an action list you may follow.

**Step 1.**
Examine the weak form and its implementation carefully.
Check that all terms are multiplied by ``dx`` or ``ds``, and that the
terms do not vanish; check that at least one term has both a
``TrialFunction`` and a ``TestFunction`` (term with unknown); and check
that at least one term has no ``TrialFunction`` (known term).

**Step 2.**
Check that Dirichlet boundary conditions are set correctly.

.. code-block:: python

    # bcs is list of DirichletBC objects
    for bc in bcs:
    bc_dict = bc.get_boundary_values()
        for dof in bc_dict:
            print('dof %d: value=%s' % (dof, bc_dict[dof]))

See also an expanded version of this snippet in the ``solvers_bc``
``ft08_poisson_vc.py`` file located in the directory ``poisson``.

A next step in the debugging, if these values are wrong, is to
call the functions that define the boundary parts. For example,

.. code-block:: python

    for coor in mesh.coordinates():
        if my_boundary_function(coor, True):
            print('%s is on the boundary' % coor)
    
    # or, in case of a SubDomain subclass my_subdomain_object,
    for coor in mesh.coordinates():
        if my_subdomain_object.inside(coor, True):
            print('%s is on the boundary' % coor)

You may compute points along a line and plot the solution along
this line (see the ``prog['membrane'].py`` example). You may also print
out the Dirichlet values as shown in the ``prog['heat'].py`` and
``prog['poisson_vc'].py`` files.

**Step 4.**
Switching to a simple set of coefficients and boundary conditions,
such that the solution becomes simple too,
but still obeys the same PDE, may help since it is then easier to
examine numerical values in the solution array.

**Step 5.**
Formulate a corresponding 1D problem. Often this can be
done by just running the problem with a 1D mesh. Doing hand calculations
of element matrices and vectors, and comparing the assembled system
from these hand calculations with the assembled system from the
FEniCS program can uncover bugs. For nonlinear problems, or problems
with variable coefficients, it is usually wise to choose simple
coefficients so that the problem becomes effectively linear and the
hand calculations are doable.

To-do list
==========

AL list
-------

 * Title?: Writing State-of-the-Art Finite Element Solvers in Minutes
   (HPL: Yes - let's have this for a while)

 * Title: "Writing... in minutes" sounds more like a good subtitle
   than an actual title. We already have a good subtitle in "The
   FEniCS tutorial" so let's try to find a more "serious" main title.
   (HPL: What about switching?)

 * Title?: Introduction to Finite Element Programming

 * Add 2nd author

 * Rewrite abstract to reflect new title and non-initial state of book

 * Rename and expand Chapter 5: Boundary conditions, markers and subdomains
   (many and confusing ways to do this, ``MeshFunctions``, ``MeshData``, etc)
   (HPL: This is important and confusing, but very much needed early on)

 * DONE: Add chapter on installation (difficult, still in flux)

 * Installation chapter should be number 0

 * Remove capitalization of sections in Chapter 8

 * Add new chapter: "Advanced example: Linear elasticity"
   (HPL: do this first - important for many courses)

 * Add new chapter: "Advanced example: Hyperelasticity"

 * Add new chapter: "Advanced example: Incompressible Navier-Stokes"

 * Place these chapters near end of book so progression becomes:

    * Installation

    * Fundamentals (3 chapters: Fundamentals, Time-dependent, Nonlinear)

    * Misc technical chapters (boundary conditions, geometries etc)
      (HPL: Think we need these things before time-dependent, or maybe
      split the very simplest things from time-dependent (1st example)
      and nonlinear (``solve(F==0, ...)``) and place in fundamentals?)

    * Advanced examples (using previously discussed techniques)

 * Add chapter on performance and profiling? HPL: Yes!

 * Move source code links to ``http://fenisproject.org/tutorial`` (we can
   set up a cron job to copy files from ``hplgit``)

 * Number examples sequentially, something like

    * ``fenics_tutorial_01_poisson_first.py``

    * ``fenics_tutorial_05_poisson_nonlinear.py``

   Hierarchic structure becomes complicated, better with flat structure
   (HPL: These filenames are too long, giving too long lines in the text
   and the need for lots of rewrites. We have an automated scheme to
   assign new filenames to the logical files that we use for the text.
   Right now the names are ``ft01_poisson.py``.)

 * Add command ``fenics-version``

 * DONE: Use dot and grad in Poisson example (not ``inner`` and ``nabla_grad``)

 * Use new notation ``'P'`` instead of ``'Lagrange'`` in ``FunctionSpace``. HPL: Done.
   (HPL: Not yet documented in ``FunctionSpace`` ;-)

 * DONE: Use ``from fenics import *``

 * Fix copyright footer so we avoid the linebreak. HPL: Fixed. This and similar adjustments in the latex file is easily done by auto editing in ``make.sh``.

 * How does doconce handle - and ---? HPL: Like latex. Just use ndash if you want. ndash and mdash are ignored in other formats than latex and html where there is no support for this. Just introduce ndash where you like, as in Navier - Stokes.

 * When to use :math:`{\thinspace .}` and when to use . ? HPL: Springer had a rule with thinspace. I don't know if it applies to the brief series, but it became a habit of mine since other styles demanded it.

 * When to specify floats as 2 or 2.0? HPL: In code? Anytime there is
   a danger of integer division.

 * When do talk about a function ``foo`` or ``foo()``. HPL: If parameters in any
   way are considered important, include them, otherwise just the function
   name. (Need to know info.)

 * varproblem reads: find ... or varproblem reads: Find ...?
   HPL: I use lower case after colon, even if full sentence - that's more usual
   in English I was told than our Scandinavian style.

 * Need to include example of mixed problems (systems) in book 1.
   HPL: Agree.

 * Consistency check for mesh size: 16 x 16 good choice overall?
   HPL: Depends. If we have exact numerical solution, a very coarse mesh
   suffices, otherwise we should have at least two meshes and report
   the error fraction. But 16 x 16 sounds reasonable as numbers in the
   demo programs.

 * Add little box in all examples listing what new features are
   explained for the particular example.
   HPL: Good idea!

 * Should all code files be included in the text?
   HPL: No, we run out of space. Can do it in the beginning. Later, the
   codes also grow in size, and I think codes that span two pages or more
   give a "boring" look in the book. People won't read it...
   Instead we use the mako construction to link to the repo file.
   It has nice syntax highlighting, comes up in a separate window if you
   want, and can be downloaded. Maybe we need to explain "raw" the first
   time we link to a github file?

 * Possible extra appendix chapters (but we don't seem to have enough
   space):
   List of finite element spaces + picture of Periodic Table,
   List of UFL operators,
   List of variational forms for common PDE,
   Notation and conventions for simplices,
   List of most useful FEniCS classes and most useful member functions: Mesh, FunctionSpace, VectorFunctionSpace, DirichletBC, etc.

HPL list
--------

Remember: cannot exceed 150 pages (as reported at the end of ``ftut.log``).
Solutions to exercises will not appear in the printed book. If we run
out of pages, we can also remove the exercises by putting if-else
constructs around them. There will be one short printed tutorial and
then extended e-versions with exercises (and optionally solution) on our
github web site.

Regarding layout, we must use ``svmono.cls`` for the printed book, but
are allowed to use gray background in code boxes and lmodern instead
of Courier for monospace font. Springer's official ebook has exactly
the same layout. For all other versions on our github
web site, we can choose whatever layout we want.

 * ``mshr`` must align subdomains with cell facets!! Important feature.

 * Demonstrate that meshes and mesh functions can be stored in XML files.

 * Programs are now flat demos. Educate the reader with
   better software engineering habits: functions, classes, unit tests.
   Avoid copy-and-edit flat programs implied by today's collection. (HPL)

 * Find successful exercises from various tutorials (AL) and add as
   exercises in the book (HPL/AL). Exercises are key for learning
   software so having them (in an extended version?) sends an important
   signal about their relevance.

 * According to the ``plot`` doc string, it should be easy to
   plot the element a la ``plot(u.function_space().ufl_element())`` but I
   did not get this to work. Not crucial, but plotting the element is a
   nice feature :-)

 * Comment regarding FEniCS demos: The documented demos mention a lot
   of packages: DOLFIN, FFC, Fiat, ... Make sure the reader of the tutorial
   does not get lost in the jungle of packages and make sure the names are
   explained somewhere in the text
   such that the tutorial is a good background for
   understanding every demo in every detail.

 * Introduce ``near(x, x0, eps``)` earlier? Not used until it got the ``eps``
   argument, but is more readable. Important to understand the
   underlying problem with rounding which is more explicit when doing
   ``abs(x-x0) < eps``.

 * Can we change the value of ``DOLFIN_EPS``? ``imort fenics; fenics.DOLFIN_EPS=...`` will work, but then all modules in the simulator must do ``import fenics``. Note that its value is very strict, e.g., ``10.1+10.2`` has rounding :math:`3.5 10^{-15}`, so ``DOLFIN_EPS`` is strictly for scaled problems only, where all variables are in :math:`[0,1]`.

HPL questions
-------------

Iterative linear solvers info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can get this printed out on the screen, but is there any method to
extract this text inside the program, such that we can see how many
Krylov iterations we do etc.? Any way for Python to capture the standard
output stream in C++?

Easy to write a script that post-processes
the output, but we have to wait until the simulator has terminated, or
we can pipe to a script ``process.py`` that treats the output in some
desired way (could append some into to a file and that is reopened
by the simulator):

.. code-block:: text

    Terminal> python mysolver.py | process.py

where the simplest ``process.py`` is

.. code-block:: python

    import sys, time
    t0 = time.clock()
    while True:
        line = sys.stdin.readline()
        if not line:
            break
        t1 = time.clock()
        print 'after %g seconds: %s' % (t1-t0, line.rstrip())
    print 'END'
