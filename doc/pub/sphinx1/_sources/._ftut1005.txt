Subdomains and boundary conditions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    So far, we have only looked briefly at how to specify boundary
    conditions. In this chapter, we look more closely at how to specify
    boundary conditions on specific parts (subdomains) of the boundary and
    how to combine multiple boundary conditions. We will also look at how to
    generate meshes with subdomains and how to define coefficients and
    variational problems that look different in different subdomains.
