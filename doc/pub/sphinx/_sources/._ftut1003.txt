Fundamentals: Solving the Poisson equation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


..

    The goal of this chapter is to show how the Poisson equation, the
    most basic of all PDEs, can be quickly solved with a few lines
    of FEniCS code. We introduce the most
    fundamental FEniCS objects such as ``Mesh``, ``Function``,
    ``FunctionSpace``, ``TrialFunction``,
    and ``TestFunction``, and learn how to write a basic PDE solver,
    including the specification of the mathematical variational problem,
    applying boundary conditions, calling the FEniCS solver, and plotting
    the solution.



.. _ftut:poisson1:bvp:

Mathematical problem formulation          (1)
=============================================

.. index:: Poisson's equation

Let us start by writing a "Hello, World!" program. In the world of
PDEs, this must be a program that solves the Poisson equation:

.. _Eq:ftut:poisson1:

.. math::

    \tag{1}
    - \nabla^2 u(\boldsymbol{x}) = f(\boldsymbol{x}),\quad \boldsymbol{x}\mbox{ in } \Omega,
        
        

.. _Eq:ch:poisson0:bc:

.. math::

    \tag{2}
    u(\boldsymbol{x}) = u_0(\boldsymbol{x}),\quad \boldsymbol{x}\mbox{ on } \partial \Omega{\thinspace .} 
        

Here, :math:`u = u(\boldsymbol{x})` is the unknown function, :math:`f = f(\boldsymbol{x})` is a
prescribed function, :math:`\nabla^2` is the Laplace operator (also
often written as :math:`\Delta`), :math:`\Omega` is the spatial domain, and
:math:`\partial\Omega` is the boundary of :math:`\Omega`. A stationary PDE like
this, together with a complete set of boundary conditions, constitute
a *boundary-value problem*, which must be precisely stated before
it makes sense to start solving it with FEniCS.

In two space dimensions with coordinates :math:`x` and :math:`y`, we can write out
the Poisson equation as

.. _Eq:_auto1:

.. math::

    \tag{3}
    - {\partial^2 u\over\partial x^2} -
        {\partial^2 u\over\partial y^2} = f(x,y){\thinspace .}
        
        

The unknown :math:`u` is now a function of two variables, :math:`u = u(x,y)`, defined
over a two-dimensional domain :math:`\Omega`.

The Poisson equation arises in numerous physical contexts, including
heat conduction, electrostatics, diffusion of substances, twisting of
elastic rods, inviscid fluid flow, and water waves. Moreover, the
equation appears in numerical splitting strategies of more complicated
systems of PDEs, in particular the Navier - Stokes equations.

Solving a PDE such as the Poisson equation in FEniCS consists of the
following steps:

 1. Identify the computational domain (:math:`\Omega`), the PDE, its
    boundary conditions, and source terms (:math:`f`).

 2. Reformulate the PDE as a finite element variational problem.

 3. Write a Python program which defines the computational domain,
    the variational problem, the boundary conditions, and source
    terms, using the corresponding FEniCS abstractions.

 4. Call FEniCS to solve the PDE and, optionally, extend the program
    to compute derived quantities such as fluxes and averages, and
    visualize the results.

We shall now go through steps 2 - 4 in detail. The key feature of
FEniCS is that steps 3 and 4 result in fairly short code, while most
other software frameworks for PDEs require much more code and more
technically difficult programming.

.. _ch:poisson0:varform:

Finite element variational formulation          (1)
---------------------------------------------------

.. index:: variational formulation

FEniCS is based on the finite element method, which is a general and
efficient mathematical machinery for numerical solution of PDEs. The
starting point for the finite element methods is a PDE expressed in
*variational form*. Readers who are not familiar with variational
problems will get a brief introduction to the topic in this tutorial,
but getting and reading a proper book on the finite element method in
addition is encouraged. The section :ref:`ftut:fembooks` contains a list of
some suitable books.

.. index:: test function

.. index:: trial function

The basic recipe for turning a PDE into a variational problem is to
multiply the PDE by a function :math:`v`, integrate the resulting equation
over the domain :math:`\Omega`, and perform integration by parts of terms
with second-order derivatives. The function :math:`v` which multiplies the
PDE is called a *test function*. The unknown function :math:`u` to be
approximated is referred to as a *trial function*. The terms test and
trial function are used in FEniCS programs too. Suitable function
spaces must be specified for the test and trial functions. For
standard PDEs arising in physics and mechanics such spaces are well
known.

In the present case, we first multiply the Poisson equation
by the test function :math:`v` and integrate over :math:`\Omega`:

.. _Eq:ch:poisson0:multbyv:

.. math::

    \tag{4}
    -\int_\Omega (\nabla^2 u)v {\, \mathrm{d}x} = \int_\Omega fv {\, \mathrm{d}x}{\thinspace .} 

We then apply integration by parts to the integrand with
second-order derivatives. We find that

.. _Eq:ch:poisson0:eqbyparts:

.. math::

    \tag{5}
    -\int_\Omega (\nabla^2 u)v {\, \mathrm{d}x}
        = \int_\Omega\nabla u\cdot\nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x} - \int_{\partial\Omega}{\partial u\over
        \partial n}v {\, \mathrm{d}s} ,
        

where :math:`\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} = \nabla u \cdot n` is the
derivative of :math:`u` in the outward normal direction :math:`n` on the
boundary. The test function :math:`v` is required to vanish on the parts of
the boundary where the solution :math:`u` is known, which in the present
problem implies that :math:`v=0` on the whole boundary :math:`\partial\Omega`.
The second term on the right-hand side of
:ref:`(5) <Eq:ch:poisson0:eqbyparts>` therefore vanishes. From
:ref:`(4) <Eq:ch:poisson0:multbyv>` and :ref:`(5) <Eq:ch:poisson0:eqbyparts>` it
follows that

.. _Eq:ch:poisson0:weak1:

.. math::

    \tag{6}
    \int_\Omega\nabla u\cdot\nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x} = \int_\Omega fv {\, \mathrm{d}x}{\thinspace .}
        
        

If we require that this equation holds for all test functions :math:`v` in
some suitable space :math:`\hat V`, the so-called *test space*, we obtain a
well-defined mathematical problem that uniquely determines the
solution :math:`u` which lies in some (possibly different) function space
:math:`V`, the so-called *trial space*.  We refer to
:ref:`(6) <Eq:ch:poisson0:weak1>` as the *weak form* or *variational form* of
the original boundary-value problem
:ref:`(1) <Eq:ftut:poisson1>`--:ref:`(2) <Eq:ch:poisson0:bc>`.

The proper statement of
our variational problem now goes as follows:
Find :math:`u \in V` such that

.. _Eq:ch:poisson0:var:

.. math::

    \tag{7}
    \int_{\Omega} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x} =
          \int_{\Omega} fv {\, \mathrm{d}x}
          \quad \forall v \in \hat{V}{\thinspace .}
        

The trial and test spaces :math:`V` and :math:`\hat V` are in the present
problem defined as

.. math::
        
             V      &= \{v \in H^1(\Omega) : v = u_0 \mbox{ on } \partial\Omega\}, \\ 
            \hat{V} &= \{v \in H^1(\Omega) : v = 0 \mbox{ on } \partial\Omega\}{\thinspace .}
        

In short, :math:`H^1(\Omega)` is the mathematically well-known Sobolev space
containing functions :math:`v` such that :math:`v^2` and :math:`|\nabla v|^2` have
finite integrals over :math:`\Omega` (essentially meaning that the functions
are continuous). The solution of the underlying PDE must lie in a
function space where also the derivatives are continuous, but the
Sobolev space :math:`H^1(\Omega)` allows functions with discontinuous
derivatives. This weaker continuity requirement of :math:`u` in the
variational statement :ref:`(7) <Eq:ch:poisson0:var>`, as a result of the
integration by parts, has great practical consequences when it comes
to constructing finite element function spaces. In particular, it
allows the use of piecewise polynomial function spaces; i.e., function
spaces constructed by stitching together polynomial functions on simple
domains such as intervals, triangles, or tetrahedrons.

The variational problem :ref:`(7) <Eq:ch:poisson0:var>` is a *continuous
problem*: it defines the solution :math:`u` in the infinite-dimensional
function space :math:`V`. The finite element method for the Poisson equation
finds an approximate solution of the variational problem
:ref:`(7) <Eq:ch:poisson0:var>` by replacing the infinite-dimensional function
spaces :math:`V` and :math:`\hat{V}` by *discrete* (finite-dimensional) trial and
test spaces :math:`V_h\subset{V}` and :math:`\hat{V}_h\subset\hat{V}`. The discrete variational problem reads: Find :math:`u_h \in
V_h \subset V` such that

.. _Eq:ch:poisson0:vard:

.. math::

    \tag{8}
    \int_{\Omega} \nabla u_h \cdot \nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x} =
          \int_{\Omega} fv {\, \mathrm{d}x}
          \quad \forall v \in \hat{V}_h \subset \hat{V}{\thinspace .}
        

This variational problem, together with a suitable definition of the
function spaces :math:`V_h` and :math:`\hat{V}_h`, uniquely defines our approximate
numerical solution of Poisson's equation :ref:`(1) <Eq:ftut:poisson1>`. The
mathematical framework may seem complicated at first glance, but the
good news is the finite element variational problem
:ref:`(8) <Eq:ch:poisson0:vard>` looks the same as the continuous variational
problem :ref:`(7) <Eq:ch:poisson0:var>`, and FEniCS can automatically solve
variational problems like :ref:`(8) <Eq:ch:poisson0:vard>`!

.. The choice of :math:`\hat{V}_h` and :math:`V_h` follows directly from the kind of

.. finite elements we want to apply in our problem. For example, choosing

.. the well-known linear triangular element with three nodes implies that

.. :math:`\hat V_h` and :math:`V_h` are the spaces of all piecewise linear functions

.. over a mesh of triangles, where the functions in :math:`\hat V_h` are zero

.. on the boundary and those in :math:`V_h` equal :math:`u_0` on the boundary.


.. admonition:: What we mean by the notation :math:`u` and :math:`V`

   The mathematics literature on variational problems writes :math:`u_h` for
   the solution of the discrete problem and :math:`u` for the solution of the
   continuous problem. To obtain (almost) a one-to-one relationship
   between the mathematical formulation of a problem and the
   corresponding FEniCS program, we shall drop the subscript :math:`_h` and use
   :math:`u` for the solution of the discrete problem and :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}` for the exact
   solution of the continuous problem, *if* we need to explicitly distinguish
   between the two. Similarly, we will let :math:`V` denote the discrete finite
   element function space in which we seek our solution.




.. _ch:poisson0:abstrat:

Abstract finite element variational formulation
-----------------------------------------------

.. index:: abstract variational formulation

It turns out to be convenient to introduce the following canonical
notation for variational problems:

.. _Eq:_auto2:

.. math::

    \tag{9}
    a(u, v) = L(v){\thinspace .}
        
        

For the Poisson equation, we have:

.. _Eq:ch:poisson0:vard:a:

.. math::

    \tag{10}
    a(u, v) = \int_{\Omega} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x},
        
        

.. _Eq:ch:poisson0:vard:L:

.. math::

    \tag{11}
    L(v) = \int_{\Omega} fv {\, \mathrm{d}x}{\thinspace .}  
        

From the mathematics literature, :math:`a(u,v)` is known as a *bilinear
form* and :math:`L(v)` as a *linear form*.  We shall in every linear problem
we solve identify the terms with the unknown :math:`u` and collect them in
:math:`a(u,v)`, and similarly collect all terms with only known functions in
:math:`L(v)`. The formulas for :math:`a` and :math:`L` are then coded directly in the
program.

FEniCS provides all the necessary mathematical notation needed to
express the variational problem :math:`a(u, v) = L(v)`. To solve a linear
PDE in FEniCS, such as the Poisson equation, a user thus needs to
perform only two steps:

  * Express the PDE as a (discrete) variational problem: find :math:`u\in V`
    such that :math:`a(u,v) = L(v)` for all :math:`v\in \hat{V}`.

  * Choose the finite element spaces :math:`V` and :math:`\hat V` by specifying
    the domain (the mesh) and the type of function space (polynomial
    degree and type).

.. Thereafter, mako is executed and we can also have %if syntax.)

.. _ch:poisson0:testproblem:

Choosing a test problem
-----------------------

The Poisson equation :ref:`(1) <Eq:ftut:poisson1>` has so far featured a general
domain :math:`\Omega` and general functions :math:`u_0` and :math:`f`. For our first
implementation, we must decide on specific choices of :math:`\Omega`, :math:`u_0`,
and :math:`f`.  It will be wise to construct a specific problem where we can
easily check that the computed solution is correct. Solutions that are
lower-order polynomials are primary candidates. Standard finite
element function spaces of degree :math:`r` will exactly reproduce
polynomials of degree :math:`r`. And piecewise linear elements (:math:`r=1`) are
able to exactly reproduce a quadratic polynomial on a uniformly
partitioned mesh. This important result can be used to verify our
implementation. We just manufacture some quadratic function in 2D as
the exact solution, say

.. _Eq:ch:poisson0:impl:uex:

.. math::

    \tag{12}
    \
        {u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x,y) = 1 +x^2 + 2y^2{\thinspace .}
        

By inserting :ref:`(12) <Eq:ch:poisson0:impl:uex>` into the Poisson equation
:ref:`(1) <Eq:ftut:poisson1>`, we find that :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x,y)` is a solution if

.. math::
         f(x,y) = -6,\quad u_0(x,y)={u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x,y)=1 + x^2 + 2y^2,

regardless of the shape of the domain as long as :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}` is prescribed along
the boundary. We choose here, for simplicity,
the domain to be the unit square,

.. math::
         \Omega = [0,1]\times [0,1] {\thinspace .}

This simple but very powerful method for constructing test problems
is called the *method of manufactured solutions*: pick a simple
expression for the exact solution, plug it into the equation to obtain
the right-hand side (source term :math:`f`), then solve the equation with
this right-hand side and try to reproduce the exact solution.


.. admonition:: Tip: Try to verify your code with exact numerical solutions

   A common approach to testing the implementation of a numerical method
   is to compare the numerical
   solution with an exact analytical solution of the test problem and
   conclude that the program works if the error is "small enough".
   Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell if an error of size :math:`10^{-5}` on a
   :math:`20\times 20` mesh of linear elements is the expected (in)accuracy of the
   numerical approximation or if the error also contains the effect of a
   bug in the code. All we usually know about the numerical error is its
   *asymptotic properties*, for instance that it is proportional to :math:`h^2`
   if :math:`h` is the size of a cell in the mesh. Then we can compare the
   error on meshes with different :math:`h` values to see if the asymptotic
   behavior is correct. This is a very powerful verification
   technique and is explained in detail in the section :ref:`ch:poisson0:convrates`.
   However, if we have a test problem for which
   we know that there should be no approximation errors, we know that
   the analytical solution of the PDE problem should be reproduced to
   machine precision by the program. That is why we emphasize this kind
   of test problems throughout this tutorial. Typically, elements of
   degree :math:`r` can reproduce polynomials of degree :math:`r` exactly, so this
   is the starting point for constructing a solution without numerical
   approximation errors.




.. _ch:poisson0:impl:

FEniCS implementation
---------------------

A FEniCS program for solving our test problem for the Poisson equation
in 2D with the given choices of :math:`u_0`, :math:`f`, and :math:`\Omega` may look as
follows:

.. code-block:: python

        from fenics import *
        
        # Create mesh and define function space
        mesh = UnitSquareMesh(8, 8)
        V = FunctionSpace(mesh, 'P', 1)
        
        # Define boundary conditions
        u0 = Expression('1 + x[0]*x[0] + 2*x[1]*x[1]', degree=2)
        
        def u0_boundary(x, on_boundary):
            return on_boundary
        
        bc = DirichletBC(V, u0, u0_boundary)
        
        # Define variational problem
        u = TrialFunction(V)
        v = TestFunction(V)
        f = Constant(-6.0)
        a = dot(grad(u), grad(v))*dx
        L = f*v*dx
        
        # Compute solution
        u = Function(V)
        solve(a == L, u, bc)
        
        # Plot solution on the screen
        u.rename('u', 'solution')
        plot(u)
        plot(mesh)
        
        # Dump solution to file in VTK format
        vtkfile = File('poisson.pvd')
        vtkfile << u
        
        # Compute error in L2 norm
        error_L2norm = errornorm(u0, u, 'L2')
        
        # Compute maximum error at vertices
        vertex_values_u0 = u0.compute_vertex_values(mesh)
        vertex_values_u  = u.compute_vertex_values(mesh)
        import numpy as np
        error_vertices = np.max(np.abs(vertex_values_u0 - vertex_values_u))
        
        # Print errors
        print('error_L2norm   =', error_L2norm)
        print('error_vertices =', error_vertices)
        
        # Hold plot
        interactive()

The complete code can be found in the file `ft01_poisson_flat.py <https://github.com/hplgit/fenics-tutorial/blob/master/src/ft01_poisson_flat.py>`__.

.. _ch:poisson0:impl:run:

Running the program
-------------------

The FEniCS program must be available in a plain text file, written with a
text editor such as Atom, Sublime Text, Emacs, Vim, or similar.

There are several ways to run a Python program like
``ft01_poisson_flat.py``:

 * Use a terminal window

 * Use an intergrated development environment (IDE), e.g., Spyder

 * Use a Jupyter notebook

Terminal window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open a terminal
window, move to the directory containing the program and type the
following command:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> python ft01_poisson_flat.py

Note that this command must be run in a FEniCS-enabled terminal. For
users of the FEniCS Docker containers, this means that you must type
this command after you have started a FEniCS session using
``fenicsproject run``.

When running the above command, FEniCS will run the program to compute
the approximate solution :math:`u`. The approximate solution :math:`u` will be
compared to the exact solution :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}` and the error in the maximum
norm will be printed. Since we know that our approximate solution
should reproduced the exact solution to within machine precision, this
error should be small, something on the order of :math:`10^{-15}`.

[**AL 1**: Add text here discussing what to expect in terms of plotting.  Perhaps we have seamless notebook plotting working soon...]

.. A plot window pops up showing how the solution :math:`u` looks like as a

.. surface.  With the left mouse button you can tilt the figure. Click

.. ``m`` to bring up the underlying mesh. Click ``p`` to save to a PNG file

.. ``dolfin_plot_0.png`` and ``P`` to save to a PDF file

.. ``dolfin_plot_1.pdf``. To kill the plot window and terminate the

.. application, click ``Ctrl+q`` (hold down the ``Ctrl`` key and press ``q``).

.. Figure :ref:`ch:poisson0:2D:fig:ex1:u` displays the surface and the mesh

.. below.  Since :math:`u` is a simple quadratic function, constructed for

.. testing our solver, the surface looks quite boring.

.. _ch:poisson0:2D:fig:ex1:u:

.. figure:: ex1_u.png
   :width: 600

   *Plot of the solution in the first FEniCS example*

Spyder
~~~~~~

Many prefer to work in an integrated development environment where there is
an editor for programming, a window for executing code, a window for
inspecting objects, etc. The Spyder tool comes with all major Python
installations. Just open the file ``ft01_poisson_flat.py`` and press
the play button to run it. We refer to the Spyder tutorial to learn more
about working in the Spyder environment. Spyder is highly recommended
if you are used to working in the *graphical* MATLAB environment.

Jupyter notebooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notebooks make it possible to mix text and executable code in the same
document, but you can also just use it to run programs in a web browser.
Start ``jupyter notebook`` from a terminal window, find the **New** pulldown
menu in the upper right part of the GUI, choose a new notebook in
Python 2 or 3, write ``%load ft01_poisson_flat.py`` in the blank
cell of this notebook, then write Shift+Enter to execute the cell.
The file ``ft01_poisson_flat.py`` will the be loaded into the notebook.
Re-execute the cell (Shift+Enter) to run the program. You may divide the
entire program into several cells to examine intermediate results: place
the cursor where you want to split the cell and choose **Edit - Split Cell**.

[**hpl 2**: Need to describe this with more care. The first program seems to have some problems with printing the error to the notebook unless we drop the plot commands. Anyway, there should be in-browser plot commands.]

.. _ch:poisson0:impl:dissect:

Dissection of the program
-------------------------

We shall now dissect this FEniCS program in detail. The program is
written in the Python programming language. You may either take a
quick look at the `official Python tutorial <http://docs.python.org/tutorial/>`__ to pick up the basics of Python if
you are unfamiliar with the language, or you may learn enough Python
as you go along with the examples in the present tutorial. The latter
strategy has proven to work for many newcomers to FEniCS. This is
because both the amount of abstract mathematical formalism and the
amount of Python expertise that is actually needed to be productive
with FEniCS is quite limited. And Python is an easy-to-learn language
that you will certainly come to love and use far beyond FEniCS
programming. The section :ref:`ftut:pybooks` lists some relevant Python
books.

The listed FEniCS program defines a finite element mesh, a finite
element function space :math:`V` on this mesh, boundary conditions for :math:`u`
(the function :math:`u_0`), and the bilinear and linear forms :math:`a(u,v)` and
:math:`L(v)`.  Thereafter, the unknown trial function :math:`u` is computed. Then
we can compare the numerical and exact solution as well as visualize
the computed solution :math:`u`.

The important first line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first line in the program,

.. code-block:: python

        from fenics import *

imports the key classes ``UnitSquareMesh``, ``FunctionSpace``, ``Function``,
and so forth, from the FEniCS library.  All FEniCS programs for
solving PDEs by the finite element method normally start with this
line.

.. index:: Mesh

Generating simple meshes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The statement

.. code-block:: python

        mesh = UnitSquareMesh(8, 8)

defines a uniform finite element mesh over the unit square
:math:`[0,1]\times [0,1]`. The mesh consists of *cells*, which in 2D are triangles
with straight sides. The parameters 8 and 8 specify that the square
should be divided into :math:`8\times 8` rectangles, each divided into a pair of
triangles. The total number of triangles (cells) thus becomes
128. The total number of vertices in the mesh is :math:`9\cdot 9=81`.
In later chapters, you will learn how to generate more complex meshes.

[**hpl 3**: Note that plot was made by the old partitioning :math:`6\times 4`. Probably no issue.]

.. index:: FunctionSpace

.. index:: finite element specifications

.. index:: CG finite element family

.. index:: Lagrange finite element family

.. index:: P1 element

Defining the finite element function space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Having a mesh, we can define a finite element function space ``V`` over
this mesh:

.. code-block:: python

        V = FunctionSpace(mesh, 'P', 1)

The second argument ``'P``' specifies the type of element, while the third
argument is the degree of the basis functions of the element. The type
of element is here "P", implying the standard Lagrange family of
elements. You may also use ``'Lagrange'`` to specify this type of
element. FEniCS supports all simplex element families and the notation
defined in the `Periodic Table of the Finite Elements <http://femtable.org>`__ [Ref21]_.

.. index:: Periodic Table of the Finite Elements

The third argument ``1`` specifies the degree of the finite element.  In
this case, the standard :math:`\mathsf{P}_1` linear Lagrange element, which
is a triangle with nodes at the three vertices. Some finite element
practitioners refer to this element as the "linear triangle". The
computed solution :math:`u` will be continuous and linearly varying in :math:`x`
and :math:`y` over each cell in the mesh. Higher-degree polynomial
approximations over each cell are trivially obtained by increasing the
third parameter to ``FunctionSpace``, which will then generate function
spaces of type :math:`\mathsf{P}_2`, :math:`\mathsf{P}_3`, and so forth.
Changing the second parameter to ``'DP'`` creates a function
space for discontinuous Galerkin methods.

.. index:: TestFunction

.. index:: TrialFunction

.. index:: DirichletBC

.. index:: Dirichlet boundary conditions

Defining the trial and test functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In mathematics, we distinguish between the trial and test spaces :math:`V`
and :math:`\hat{V}`. The only difference in the present problem is the
boundary conditions. In FEniCS we do not specify the boundary
conditions as part of the function space, so it is sufficient to work
with one common space ``V`` for the and trial and test functions in the
program:

.. code-block:: python

        u = TrialFunction(V)
        v = TestFunction(V)

.. index:: boundary specification (function)

Defining the boundary and the boundary conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next step is to specify the boundary condition: :math:`u=u_0` on
:math:`\partial\Omega`. This is done by

.. code-block:: python

        bc = DirichletBC(V, u0, u0_boundary)

where ``u0`` is an expression defining the solution values on the
boundary, and ``u0_boundary`` is a function (or object) defining
which points belong to the boundary.

Boundary conditions of the type :math:`u=u_0` are known as *Dirichlet
conditions*. For the present finite element method for the Poisson
problem, they are also called *essential boundary conditions*, as they
need to be imposed explicitly as part of the trial space (in contrast
to being defined implicitly as part of the variational formulation).
Naturally, the FEniCS class used to define Dirichlet boundary
conditions is named ``DirichletBC``.

.. index:: Expression

The variable ``u0`` refers to an ``Expression`` object, which is used to
represent a mathematical function. The typical construction is

.. code-block:: python

        u0 = Expression(formula, degree=1)

where ``formula`` is a string containing the mathematical expression.
This formula is written with C++ syntax. The expression is
automatically turned into an efficient, compiled C++ function.
The second argument ``degree`` is a parameter that specifies how
the expression should be treated in computations. FEniCS will
interpolate the expression into some finite element space. It is
usually a good choice to interpolate expressions into the same
space :math:`V` that is used for the trial and test functions,
but in certain cases, one may want to use a more accurate (higher
degree) representation of expressions.

The expression may depend on the variables ``x[0]`` and ``x[1]``
corresponding to the :math:`x` and :math:`y` coordinates. In 3D, the expression
may also depend on the variable ``x[2]`` corresponding to the :math:`z`
coordinate. With our choice of :math:`u_0(x,y)=1 + x^2 + 2y^2`, the formula
string can be written as ``1 + x[0]*x[0] + 2*x[1]*x[1]``:

.. code-block:: python

        u0 = Expression('1 + x[0]*x[0] + 2*x[1]*x[1]', degree=1)

.. index:: C++ expression syntax

.. index:: expression syntax (C++)


.. admonition:: String expressions must have valid C++ syntax

   The string argument to an ``Expression`` object must obey C++ syntax.
   Most Python syntax for mathematical expressions are also valid C++ syntax,
   but power expressions make an exception: ``p**a`` must be written as
   ``pow(p,a)`` in C++ (this is also an alternative Python syntax).
   The following mathematical functions can be used directly
   in C++
   expressions when defining ``Expression`` objects:
   ``cos``, ``sin``, ``tan``, ``acos``, ``asin``,
   ``atan``, ``atan2``, ``cosh``, ``sinh``, ``tanh``, ``exp``,
   ``frexp``, ``ldexp``, ``log``, ``log10``, ``modf``,
   ``pow``, ``sqrt``, ``ceil``, ``fabs``, ``floor``, and ``fmod``.
   Moreover, the number :math:`\pi` is available as the symbol ``pi``.
   All the listed functions are taken from the ``cmath`` C++ header file, and
   one may hence
   consult the documentation of ``cmath`` for more information on the
   various functions.
   
   If/else tests are possible using the C syntax for inline branching. The
   function
   
   .. math::
            f(x,y) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll} x^2, & x, y\geq 0\\ 
           2, & \hbox{otherwise}\end{array}\right.
   
   is implemented as
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           f = Expression('x[0] >= 0 && x[1] >= 0? pow(x[0], 2) : 2', degree=1)
   
   Parameters in expression strings are allowed, but
   must be initialized via keyword
   arguments when creating the ``Expression`` object. For example, the
   function :math:`f(x)=e^{-\kappa\pi^2t}\sin(\pi k x)` can be coded as
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           f = Expression('exp(-kappa*pow(pi,2)*t)*sin(pi*k*x[0])', degree=1,
                          kappa=1.0, t=0, k=4)
   
   At any time, parameters can be updated:
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           f.t += dt
           f.k = 10




.. index:: boundary specification (function)

The function ``u0_boundary`` specifies which points that belong to the
part of the boundary where the boundary condition should be applied:

.. code-block:: python

        def u0_boundary(x, on_boundary):
            return on_boundary

A function like ``u0_boundary`` for marking the boundary must return a
boolean value: ``True`` if the given point ``x`` lies on the Dirichlet
boundary and ``False`` otherwise.  The argument ``on_boundary`` is ``True``
if ``x`` is on the physical boundary of the mesh, so in the present
case, where we are supposed to return ``True`` for all points on the
boundary, we can just return the supplied value of ``on_boundary``. The
``u0_boundary`` function will be called for every discrete point in the
mesh, which allows us to have boundaries where :math:`u` are known also
inside the domain, if desired.

One way to think about the specification of boundaries in FEniCS is
that FEniCS will ask you (or rather the function ``u0_boundary`` which
you have implemented) whether or not a specific point ``x`` is part of
the boundary. FEniCS already knows whether the point belongs to the
*actual* boundary (the mathematical boundary of the domain) and kindly
shares this information with you in the variable ``on_boundary``. You
may choose to use this information (as we do here), or ignore it
completely.

The argument ``on_boundary`` may also be omitted, but in that case we need
to test on the value of the coordinates in ``x``:

.. code-block:: python

        def u0_boundary(x):
            return x[0] == 0 or x[1] == 0 or x[0] == 1 or x[1] == 1

Comparing floating-point values using an exact match test with
``==`` is not good programming practice, because small round-off errors
in the computations of the ``x`` values could make a test ``x[0] == 1``
become false even though ``x`` lies on the boundary.  A better test is
to check for equality with a tolerance, either explicitly

.. code-block:: python

        def u0_boundary(x):
            return abs(x[0]) < tol or abs(x[1]) < tol \ 
                or abs((x[0] - 1) < tol or abs(x[1] - 1) < tol

or with the ``near`` command in FEniCS:

.. code-block:: python

        def u0_boundary(x):
            return near(x[0], 0, tol) or near(x[1], 0, tol) \ 
                or near(x[0], 1, tol) or near(x[1], 1, tol)

.. index:: UFL

Defining the source term
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before defining the bilinear and linear forms :math:`a(u,v)` and :math:`L(v)` we
have to specify the source term :math:`f`:

.. code-block:: python

        f = Expression('-6', degree=1)

When :math:`f` is constant over the domain, ``f`` can be
more efficiently represented as a ``Constant``:

.. code-block:: python

        f = Constant(-6)

Defining the variational problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We now have all the ingredients we need to define the
variational problem:

.. code-block:: python

        a = dot(grad(u), grad(v))*dx
        L = f*v*dx

In essence, these two lines specify the PDE to be solved.  Note the
very close correspondence between the Python syntax and the
mathematical formulas :math:`\nabla u\cdot\nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x}` and :math:`fv {\, \mathrm{d}x}`.  This
is a key strength of FEniCS: the formulas in the variational
formulation translate directly to very similar Python code, a feature
that makes it easy to specify and solve complicated PDE problems.  The
language used to express weak forms is called UFL (Unified Form
Language) [Ref22]_ [Ref01]_ and is an integral part of FEniCS.

.. Instead of ``grad`` we could also just have written ``grad`` in the

.. examples in this tutorial. However, when taking gradients of vector

.. fields, ``grad`` and ``grad`` differ. The latter is consistent with

.. the tensor algebra commonly used to derive vector and tensor PDEs,

.. where :math:`\nabla` ("nabla") acts as a vector operator, and therefore

.. this author prefers to always use ``grad``.

Forming and solving the linear system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Having defined the finite element variational problem and boundary
condition, we can now ask FEniCS to compute the solution:

.. code-block:: python

        u = Function(V)
        solve(a == L, u, bc)

.. Some prefer to replace ``a`` and ``L`` by an ``equation``

.. variable, which is accomplished by this equivalent code:

.. !bc pycod

.. equation = dot(grad(u), grad(v))*dx == f*v*dx

.. u = Function(V)

.. solve(equation, u, bc)

.. !ec

Note that we first defined the variable ``u`` as a ``TrialFunction`` and
used it to represent the unknown in the form ``a``. Thereafter, we
redefined ``u`` to be a ``Function`` object representing the solution;
i.e., the computed finite element function :math:`u`. This redefinition of
the variable ``u`` is possible in Python and often done in FEniCS
applications for linear problems. The two types of objects that ``u``
refers to are equal from a mathematical point of view, and hence it is
natural to use the same variable name for both objects.

.. index:: degrees of freedom

Plotting the solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the solution has been computed, it can be visualized by
the ``plot()`` command:

.. code-block:: python

        plot(u)
        plot(mesh)
        interactive()

Clicking on ``Help`` or typing ``h`` in the plot windows brings up a list
of commands. For example, typing ``m`` brings up the mesh. With the
left, middle, and right mouse buttons you can rotate, translate, and
zoom (respectively) the plotted surface to better examine what the
solution looks like. You must click ``Ctrl+q`` to kill the plot window
and continue execution beyond the command interactive()`. In the
example program, we have therefore placed the call to ``interactive()``
at the very end. Alternatively, one may use the command ``plot(u,
interactive=True)`` which again means you can interact with the plot
window and that execution will be halted until the plot window is
closed.

Figure :ref:`ch:poisson0:2D:fig:ex1:u` displays the resulting :math:`u` function.

Exporting and post-processing the solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also possible to dump the computed solution to file for
post-processing, e.g., in VTK format:

.. code-block:: python

        vtkfile = File('poisson.pvd')
        vtkfile << u

The ``poisson.pvd`` file can now be loaded into any front-end to VTK, in
particular ParaView or VisIt. The ``plot()`` function is intended for
quick examination of the solution during program development. More
in-depth visual investigations of finite element solutions will
normally benefit from using highly professional tools such as ParaView
and VisIt.

.. index:: rename

Prior to plotting and storing solutions to file it is wise to
give ``u`` a proper name by ``u.rename('u', 'solution')``. Then
``u`` will be used as name in plots (rather than the more cryptic
default names like ``f_7``).

Once the solution has been stored to file, it can be opened in
Paraview by choosing **File - Open**. Find the file ``poisson.pvd``, and
click the green **Apply** button to the left in the GUI. A 2D color plot
of :math:`u(x,y)` is then shown.  You can save the figure to file by **File -
Export Scene...** and choosing a suitable filename. For more
information about how to install and use Paraview, see the
``http://www.paraview.org/``.

Computing the error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, we compute the error to check the accuracy of the solution.
We do this by comparing the finite element solution ``u`` with the exact
solution ``u0``, which in this example happens to be the same as the
``Expression`` used to set the boundary conditions. We compute the error
in two different ways. First, we compute the :math:`L^2` norm of the error,
defined by

.. math::
         E = \sqrt{\int_\Omega (u_0 - u)^2{\, \mathrm{d}x}}{\thinspace .}

Since the exact solution is quadratic and the finite element solution
is piecewise linear, this error will be nonzero. To compute this error
in FEniCS, we simply write

.. code-block:: python

        error_L2norm = errornorm(u0, u, 'L2')

The ``errornorm()`` function can also compute other error norms such
as the :math:`H^1` norm. Type ``pydoc fenics.errornorm`` in a terminal window
for details.

We also compute the maximum value of the error at all the vertices of
the finite element mesh. As mentioned above, we expect this error to
be zero to within machine precision for this particular example. To
compute the error at the vertices, we first ask FEniCS to compute the
value of both ``u0`` and ``u`` at all vertices, and then subtract the
results:

.. code-block:: python

        vertex_values_u0 = u0.compute_vertex_values(mesh)
        vertex_values_u  = u.compute_vertex_values(mesh)
        import numpy as np
        error_vertices = np.max(np.abs(vertex_values_u0 - vertex_values_u))

We have here used maximum and absolute value functions from ``numpy``,
because these are much more efficient for large arrays (a factor of 30)
than Python's built-n ``max`` and ``abs`` functions.


.. admonition:: How to check that the error vanishes

   With inexact arithmetics, as we always have on a computer, the maximum
   error at the vertices is not zero, but should be a small number. The
   machine precision is about :math:`10^{-16}`, but in finite element
   calculations, rounding errors of this size may accumulate, to produce
   an error larger than :math:`10^{-16}`. Experiments show that increasing the
   number of elements and increasing the degree of the finite element
   polynomials increases the error. For a mesh with :math:`2\times(20\times
   20)` cubic Lagrange elements (degree 3) the error is about :math:`2\cdot
   10^{-12}`, while for 81 linear elements the error is about :math:`2\cdot
   10^{-15}`.




.. _ch:poisson0:impl:dofmap:

Degrees of freedom and vertex values
------------------------------------

A finite element function like :math:`u` is expressed as a linear combination
of basis functions :math:`\phi_j`, spanning the space :math:`V`:

.. _Eq:ch:poisson0:ufem:

.. math::

    \tag{13}
    u = \sum_{j=1}^N U_j \phi_j {\thinspace .}
        

By writing ``solve(a == L, u, bc)`` in the program, a linear system will
be formed from :math:`a` and :math:`L`, and this system is solved for the
:math:`U_1,\ldots,U_N` values. The :math:`U_1,\ldots,U_N` values are known as the
*degrees of freedom* ("dofs") or *nodal values* of :math:`u`. For Lagrange
elements (and many other element types) :math:`U_j` is simply the value of
:math:`u` at the node with global number :math:`j`. The location of the nodes and
cell vertices coincide for linear Lagrange elements, while for
higher-order elements there are additional nodes associated with the
facets, edges and sometimes also the interior of cells.

Having ``u`` represented as a ``Function`` object, we can either evaluate
``u(x)`` at any point ``x`` in the mesh (expensive operation!), or we can
grab all the degrees of freedom values :math:`U` directly by

.. code-block:: python

        u_nodal_values = u.vector()

The result is a ``Vector`` object, which is basically an encapsulation
of the vector object used in the linear algebra package that is used
to solve the linear system arising from the variational problem.
Since we program in Python it is convenient to convert the ``Vector``
object to a standard ``numpy`` array for further processing:

.. index:: degrees of freedom array

.. index:: nodal values array

.. index::
   single: numbering; degrees of freedom

.. index::
   single: numbering; cell vertices

.. code-block:: python

        u_array = u_nodal_values.array()

With ``numpy`` arrays we can write MATLAB-like code to analyze the
data. Indexing is done with square brackets: ``u_array[j]``, where the
index ``j`` always starts at ``0``. If the solution is computed with
piecewise linear Lagrange elements (:math:`\mathsf{P}_1`), then the size of
the array ``u_array`` is equal to the number of vertices, and each
``u[j]`` is the value at some vertex in the mesh. However, the degrees
of freedom are not necessarily numbered in the same way as the
vertices of the
mesh, see the section :ref:`ch:poisson0:verify1` for details.
If we therefore want to know the values at the vertices, we need to
call the function ``u.compute_vertex_values()``. This function returns
the values at all the vertices of the mesh as a ``numpy`` array with the same
numbering as for the vertices of the mesh, for example:

.. code-block:: python

        u_vertex_values = u.compute_vertex_values()

Note that ``u_array`` and ``u_vertex_values`` are arrays of the same
length and containing the same values, albeit in different order.

.. Stand-alone notebook?

.. _ch:poisson0:membrane:

Deflection of a membrane
========================

[**AL 4**: I AM HERE]

The previous problem and code targeted a simple test problem where we
can easily verify the implementation. Now we turn the attention to
a more physically relevant problem, in a non-trivial geometry, and
that results in solutions of somewhat more exciting shape.

We want to compute the deflection :math:`D(x,y)` of a two-dimensional,
circular membrane, subject to a load :math:`p` over the membrane. The
appropriate PDE model is

.. _Eq:_auto3:

.. math::

    \tag{14}
    -T\nabla^2 D = p(x,y)\quad\hbox{in }\Omega = \{ (x,y)\,\vert\, x^2+y^2\leq R\}{\thinspace .}
        
        

Here, :math:`T` is the tension in the membrane (constant), and :math:`p` is the external
pressure load.
The boundary of the membrane has no
deflection, implying :math:`D=0` as boundary condition.
A localized load can be modeled as a Gaussian function:

.. _Eq:_auto4:

.. math::

    \tag{15}
    p(x,y) = {A\over 2\pi\sigma}\exp{\left(
        - {1\over2}\left( {x-x_0\over\sigma}\right)^2
        - {1\over2}\left( {y-y_0\over\sigma}\right)^2
        \right)}\, .
        
        

The parameter :math:`A` is the amplitude of the pressure,
:math:`(x_0,y_0)` the localization of the maximum point of the load,
and :math:`\sigma` the "width" of :math:`p`.

Scaling
-------

The localization of the pressure, :math:`(x_0,y_0)`, is for simplicity
set to :math:`(0, R_0)`.
There are many physical parameters in this problem, and we can benefit
from grouping them by means of scaling. Let us introduce dimensionless
coordinates :math:`\bar x = x/R`, :math:`\bar y = y/R`, and a dimensionless
deflection :math:`w=D/D_c`, where :math:`D_c` is a characteristic size of the
deflection. Introducing :math:`\bar R_0=R_0/R`, we get

.. math::
         \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial\bar x^2} +
        \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial\bar y^2}= \alpha
        \exp{\left(
        - \beta^2(\bar x^2
        + (\bar y-\bar R_0)^2)\right)}\hbox{ for } \bar x^2 + \bar y^2 < 1,

where

.. math::
         \alpha = \frac{R^2A}{2\pi T D_c\sigma},\quad\beta = \frac{R}{\sqrt{2}\sigma}{\thinspace .}

With an appropriate scaling, :math:`\bar w` and its derivatives are of size
unity, so the left-hand side of the scaled PDE is about unity in size,
while the right-hand side has :math:`\alpha` as its characteristic size.
This suggest choosing :math:`\alpha` to be unity, or around unit.  We shall
in particular choose :math:`\alpha=4`. With this value, the solution is
:math:`w(\bar x,\bar y) = 1-\bar x^2 - \bar y^2`.  (One can also find the
analytical solution in scaled coordinates and show that the maximum
deflection :math:`D(0,0)` is :math:`D_c` if we choose :math:`\alpha=4` to determine
:math:`D_c`.)  With :math:`D_c=AR^2/(8\pi\sigma T)` and dropping the bars we get
the scaled problem

.. _Eq:ch:poisson0:membrane:scaled:eq:

.. math::

    \tag{16}
    \nabla^2w = 4\exp{\left(
        - \beta^2(x^2
        + (y-R_0)^2)\right)},
        
        

to be solved over the unit circle with :math:`w=0` on the boundary.  Now
there are only two parameters to vary: the dimensionless extent of the
pressure, :math:`\beta`, and the localization of the pressure peak, :math:`R_0\in
[0,1]`.  As :math:`\beta\rightarrow 0`, we have a special case with solution
:math:`w=1-x^2-y^2`.

Given a computed :math:`w`, the physical deflection is given by

.. math::
         D = \frac{AR^2}{8\pi\sigma T}w{\thinspace .}

Just a few modifications are necessary in our previous program to solve
this new problem.

Defining the mesh
-----------------

A mesh over the unit circle can be created by the ``mshr`` tool in
FEniCS:

.. code-block:: python

        from mshr import *
        domain = Circle(Point(0.0, 0.0), 1.0)
        n = 20
        mesh = generate_mesh(domain, n)
        plot(mesh, interactive=True)

The ``Circle`` shape from ``mshr`` takes the center and radius of the circle
as the two first arguments, while ``n`` is the resolution, here the
suggested number of cells per radius.

Defining the load
-----------------

.. index:: Expresion

.. index:: Expression with parameters

The right-hand side pressure function
is represented by an ``Expression`` object. There
are two physical parameters in the formula for :math:`f` that enter the
expression string and these parameters must have their values set
by keyword arguments:

.. code-block:: python

        beta = 8
        R0 = 0.6
        p = Expression(
            '4*exp(-pow(beta,2)*(pow(x[0], 2) + pow(x[1]-R0, 2)))',
            beta=beta, R0=R0)

The coordinates in ``Expression`` objects *must* be a vector
with indices 0, 1, and 2, and with the name ``x``. Otherwise
we are free to introduce names of parameters as long as these are
given default values by keyword arguments. All the parameters
initialized by keyword arguments can at any time have their
values modified. For example, we may set

.. code-block:: python

        p.beta = 12
        p.R0 = 0.3

.. index:: interpolation

Variational form
----------------

We may introduce ``w`` instead of ``u`` as primary unknown and ``p`` instead
of ``f`` as right-hand side function:

.. code-block:: python

        w = TrialFunction(V)
        v = TestFunction(V)
        a = dot(grad(w), grad(v))*dx
        L = p*v*dx
        
        w = Function(V)
        solve(a == L, w, bc)

.. Avoid plot command in notebook. It easily makes the kernel freeze.

Visualization
-------------

It would be of interest to visualize :math:`p` along with :math:`w` so that we can
examine the pressure force and the membrane's response.  We must then
transform the formula (``Expression``) to a finite element function
(``Function``).  The most natural approach is to construct a finite
element function whose degrees of freedom are calculated from
:math:`p`. That is, we interpolate :math:`p`:

.. code-block:: python

        p = interpolate(p, V)

Note that the assignment to ``p`` destroys the previous ``Expression``
object ``p``, so if it is of interest to still have access to this
object, another name must be used for the ``Function`` object returned
by ``interpolate``.

We can now plot ``w`` and ``p`` on the screen
as well as dump the fields to file in VTK format:

.. code-block:: python

        plot(w, title='Deflection')
        plot(p, title='Load')
        
        vtkfile1 = File('membrane_deflection.pvd')
        vtkfile1 << w
        vtkfile2 = File('membrane_load.pvd')
        vtkfile2 << p

Figure :ref:`ch:poisson0:membrane:fig` shows the result of the ``plot`` commands.

   *Load (left) and resulting deflection (right) of a circular membrane*

Curve plots through the domain
------------------------------

.. Nice with some matplotlib plots in notebooks...and very useful for

.. scientific investigations.

The best way to compare the load and the deflection is to make a curve plot
along the line :math:`x=0`. This is just a matter of defining a set of points
along the line and evaluating the finite element functions ``w`` and ``p``
at these points:

.. code-block:: python

        # Curve plot along x=0 comparing p and w
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        tol = 1E-8  # Avoid hitting points outside the domain
        y = np.linspace(-1+tol, 1-tol, 101)
        points = [(0, y_) for y_ in y]  # 2D points
        w_line = np.array([w(point) for point in points])
        p_line = np.array([p(point) for point in points])
        plt.plot(y, 100*w_line, 'r-', y, p_line, 'b--') # magnify w
        plt.legend(['100 x deflection', 'load'], loc='upper left')
        plt.xlabel('y');  plt.ylabel('$p$ and $100u$')

(Remember a ``plt.show()`` at the end to show the plot on the screen.)
The resulting curve plot appears in Figure :ref:`ch:poisson0:membrane:fig2`.
It is seen how the localized input (:math:`p`) is heavily damped and smoothened in
the output (:math:`w`). This reflects a typical property of the Poisson equation.

Running ParaView
----------------

`ParaView <http://www.paraview.org>`__ is a very strong and well-developed
tool for visualizing scalar and vector fields, including those
computed by FEniCS.

Our program file writes :math:`w` and :math:`p` to file as finite element
functions.  The default filenames are ``membrane_deflection.pvd`` for
:math:`w` and ``membrane_load.vtu`` for :math:`p`.  These files are in VTK format
and their data can be visualized in ParaView.

1. Start the ParaView application.

2. Open a file with **File - Open...**. You will see a list of ``.pvd`` and
   ``.vtu`` files. More specifically you see ``membrane_deflection.pvd``.
   Choose this file.

3. Click on **Apply** to the left (*Properties* pane) in the GUI, and
   ParaView will visualize the contents of the file, here as a color image.

4. To get rid of the axis in the lower left corner of the plot area
   and axis cross in the middle of the circle, find the *Show Orientation Axis* and *Show Center* buttons to the right in the second row of buttons at the top of the GUI. Click on these buttons to toggle axis information on/off.

5. If you want a color bar to explain the mapping between :math:`w` values and colors,
   go to the *Color Map Editor* in the right of the GUI and use the
   *Show/hide color legend* button. Alternatively, find *Coloring* in the
   lower left part of the GUI, and toggle the *Show* button.

6. The color map, by default going from blue (low values) to red (high values),
   can easily be changed. Find the *Coloring* menu in the left part of the
   GUI, click *Edit*, then in the *Color Map Editor* double click at the
   left end of the color spectrum and choose another color, say yellow, then
   double click at the right and of the spectrum and choose pink, scroll
   down to the bottom of the dialog and click *Update*. The color map now
   goes from yellow to pink.

7. To save the plot to file, click on **File - Export Scene...**,
   fill in a filename, and save.
   See Figure :ref:`ftut:paraview:figwp` (middle).

8. To change the background color of plots, choose
   **Edit - Settings...**, **Color** tab, click on **Background Color**,
   and choose it to be, e.g., white. Then choose **Foreground Color** to
   be something different.

9. To plot the mesh with colors reflecting the size of :math:`w`, find the
   *Representation* drop down menu in the left part of the GUI, and replace
   *Surface* by *Wireframe*.

10. To overlay a surface plot with a wireframe plot, load :math:`w` and plot
   as surface, then load :math:`w` again and plot as wireframe. Make sure
   both icons in the *Pipeline Browser* in the left part of the GUI
   are *on* for the ``membrane_deflection.pvd`` files you want to display.
   See Figure :ref:`ftut:paraview:figwp` (left).

11. Redo the surface plot. Then we can add some contour lines.
   Press the semi-sphere icon in the third row of buttons at the top of the
   GUI (the so-called *filters*). A set of contour values can now be
   specified at in a dialog box in the left part of the GUI. Remove
   the default contour (0.578808) and add 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05.
   Click *Apply* and see an overlay of white contour lines.
   In the *Pipeline Browser* you can click on the icons to turn
   a filter on or off.

12. Divide the plot window into two, say horizontally, using the top right
   small icon. Choose the **3D View** button. Open a new file and load
   ``memberane_load.pvd``. Click on **Apply** to see a plot of the load.

   *Default visualizations in ParaView: deflection (left, middle) and pressure load (right)*

A particularly useful feature of ParaView is that you can record GUI clicks
(**Tools - Start/Stop Trace**) and
get them translated to Python code. This allows you automate the
visualization process. You can also make curve plots along lines through
the domain, etc.

For more information, we refer to The ParaView Guide [Ref23]_
(free PDF available) and to the `ParaView tutorial <http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial>`__ as well as
an `instruction video <https://vimeo.com/34037236>`__.

Using the built-in visualization tool
-------------------------------------

.. index:: visualization

.. index:: plotting

.. index:: VTK

This section explains some useful visualization features of the
built-in visualization tool in FEniCS.  The ``plot`` command applies the
VTK package to visualize finite element functions in a very quick and
simple way.  The command is ideal for debugging, teaching, and initial
scientific investigations.  The visualization can be interactive, or
you can steer and automate it through program statements.  More
advanced and professional visualizations are usually better created
with advanced tools like Mayavi, ParaView, or VisIt.

.. index:: plot

The ``plot`` function can take additional arguments, such as
a title of the plot, or a specification of a wireframe plot (elevated mesh)
instead of a colored surface plot:

.. code-block:: python

        plot(mesh, title='Finite element mesh')
        plot(w, wireframe=True, title='Solution')

Axes can be turned on by the ``axes=True`` argument, while
``interactive=True`` makes the program hang at the plot command - you have
to type ``q`` in the plot window to terminate the plot and continue execution.

The left mouse button is used to rotate the surface, while the right
button can zoom the image in and out.  Point the mouse to the ``Help``
text down in the lower left corner to get a list of all the keyboard
commands that are available.

The plots created by pressing ``p`` or ``P`` are stored in filenames
having the form ``dolfin_plot_X.png`` or ``dolfin_plot_X.pdf``, where ``X``
is an integer that is increased by one from the last plot that was
made. The file stem ``dolfin_plot_`` can be set to something more
suitable through the ``hardcopy_prefix`` keyword argument to the ``plot``
function, for instance, ``plot(f, hardcopy_prefix='pressure')``.

.. index:: rotate PDF plots

.. index:: pdftk

Plots stored in PDF format need to be rotated 90 degrees before
inclusion in documents. This can be done by the ``convert -rotate 90``
command (from the ImageMagick utility), but the resulting file has
then no more high-resolution PDF vector graphics. A better solution
is therefore to use ``pdftk`` to preserve the vector graphics:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> pdftk dolfin_plot_1.pdf cat 1-endnorth output out.pdf

For making plots in batch, we can do the following:

.. code-block:: python

        viz_w = plot(w, interactive=False)
        viz_w.elevate(-10)  # adjust (lift) camera from the default view
        viz_w.plot(w)       # bring new settings into action
        viz_w.write_png('deflection')  # make deflection.png
        viz_w.write_pdf('deflection')  # make deflection.pdf
        # Rotate pdf file (right) from landscape to portrait
        import os
        os.system('pdftk deflection.pdf cat 1-endnorth output w.pdf')

The ranges of the color scale can be set by the ``range_min`` and ``range_max``
keyword arguments to ``plot``. The values must be ``float`` objects. These
arguments are important to keep fixed for animations in time-dependent
problems.

Exercise 1: Visualize a solution in a cube
------------------------------------------

Solve the problem :math:`-\nabla^2 u = f` on the unit cube :math:`[0,1]\times[0,1]\times
[0,1]` with :math:`u_0 = 1 + x^2 + 2y^2 - 4z^2` on the boundary.
Visualize the solution. Explore both the built-in visualization tool and
ParaView.

.. --- begin solution of exercise ---

**Solution.**
As hinted by the filename in this exercise,
a good starting point is the ``solver`` function in
the program ``ft04_poisson_func.py``, which solves the corresponding 2D
problem. Only two lines in the body of ``solver`` needs to be changed (!):
``mesh = ...``. Replace this line with

.. code-block:: python

        mesh = UnitCubeMesh(Nx, Ny, Nz)

and add ``Nz`` as argument to ``solver``. We implement the new :math:`u_0` function
in ``application_test`` and realize that the proper :math:`f(x,y,z)` function
in this new case is 2.

.. code-block:: python

        u0 = Expression('1 + x[0]*x[0] + 2*x[1]*x[1] - 4*x[2]*x[2]')
        f = Constant(2.0)
        u = solver(f, u0, 6, 4, 3, 1)

The numerical solution is without approximation errors so we can
reuse the unit test from 2D, but it needs an extra ``Nz`` parameter.

The variation in :math:`u` is only quadratic so a coarse mesh is okay for
visualization. Below is plot from the ParaView (left) and the built-in
visualization tool (right).  The usage is as in 2D, but now one can
use the mouse to rotate the 3D cube.

We can in ParaView add a contour filter and define contour surfaces for
:math:`u=-2,1,0,1,2,3`, then add a slice filter to get a slice with colors:
