Multiple domain and boundaries
==============================

[**hpl 3**: Need a little intro.]

.. _tut:poisson1:DN:

Combining Dirichlet and Neumann conditions
------------------------------------------

Let us make a slight extension of our two-dimensional Poisson problem
from the section :ref:`tut:poisson1:bvp` and add a Neumann boundary
condition. The domain is still the unit square, but now we set the
Dirichlet condition :math:`u=u_0` at the left and right sides, :math:`x=0` and
:math:`x=1`, while the Neumann condition

.. math::
        
        -{\partial u\over\partial n}=g
        

is applied to the remaining
sides :math:`y=0` and :math:`y=1`.
The Neumann condition is also known as a *natural boundary condition*
(in contrast to an essential boundary condition).

.. index:: Neumann boundary conditions

PDE problem
~~~~~~~~~~~

Let :math:`\Gamma_D` and :math:`\Gamma_N` denote the parts of :math:`\partial\Omega`
where the Dirichlet and Neumann conditions apply, respectively.  The
complete boundary-value problem can be written as

.. _Eq:_auto15:

.. math::

    \tag{31}
    - \nabla^2 u = f \mbox{ in } \Omega,  
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto16:

.. math::

    \tag{32}
    u = u_0 \mbox{ on } \Gamma_D,       
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto17:

.. math::

    \tag{33}
    - {\partial u\over\partial n} = g \mbox{ on } \Gamma_N  {\thinspace .}
        
        

Again we choose :math:`u=1+x^2 + 2y^2` as the exact solution and adjust :math:`f`, :math:`g`, and
:math:`u_0` accordingly:

.. math::
        
        f &= -6,\\ 
        g &= \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        -4, & y=1\\ 
        0,  & y=0
        \end{array}\right.\\ 
        u_0 &= 1 + x^2 + 2y^2{\thinspace .}
        

For ease of programming we may introduce a :math:`g` function defined over the whole
of :math:`\Omega` such that :math:`g` takes on the right values at :math:`y=0` and
:math:`y=1`. One possible extension is

.. math::
        
        g(x,y) = -4y{\thinspace .}
        

Variational formulation          (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first task is to derive the variational problem. This time we cannot
omit the boundary term arising from the integration by parts, because
:math:`v` is only zero on :math:`\Gamma_D`. We have

.. math::
        
         -\int_\Omega (\nabla^2 u)v {\, \mathrm{d}x}
        = \int_\Omega\nabla u\cdot\nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x} - \int_{\partial\Omega}{\partial u\over
        \partial n}v {\, \mathrm{d}s},
        

and since :math:`v=0` on :math:`\Gamma_D`,

.. math::
        
        - \int_{\partial\Omega}{\partial u\over
        \partial n}v {\, \mathrm{d}s}
        =
        - \int_{\Gamma_N}{\partial u\over
        \partial n}v {\, \mathrm{d}s}
        = \int_{\Gamma_N}gv {\, \mathrm{d}s},
        

by applying the boundary condition on :math:`\Gamma_N`.
The resulting weak form reads

.. _Eq:tut:poisson:2D:DN:weak:

.. math::

    \tag{34}
    \int_{\Omega} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x} +
        \int_{\Gamma_N} gv {\, \mathrm{d}s}
        = \int_{\Omega} fv {\, \mathrm{d}x}{\thinspace .}
        
        

Expressing this equation
in the standard notation :math:`a(u,v)=L(v)` is straightforward with

.. _Eq:tut:poisson2:vard:a:

.. math::

    \tag{35}
    a(u, v) = \int_{\Omega} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x},
        
        

.. _Eq:tut:poisson2:vard:L:

.. math::

    \tag{36}
    L(v) = \int_{\Omega} fv {\, \mathrm{d}x} -
        \int_{\Gamma_N} gv {\, \mathrm{d}s}{\thinspace .}  
        

Implementation          (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How does the Neumann condition impact the implementation?
Let us go back to the very simplest file,
``p2D_plain.py``, from
the section :ref:`tut:poisson1:impl:code`,
we realize that the statements remain almost the same.
Only two adjustments are necessary:

  * The function describing the boundary where Dirichlet conditions
    apply must be modified.

  * The new boundary term must be added to the expression in ``L``.

The first adjustment can be coded as

.. code-block:: python

        def Dirichlet_boundary(x, on_boundary):
            if on_boundary:
                if x[0] == 0 or x[0] == 1:
                    return True
                else:
                    return False
            else:
                return False

A more compact implementation reads

.. code-block:: python

        def Dirichlet_boundary(x, on_boundary):
            return on_boundary and (x[0] == 0 or x[0] == 1)


.. admonition:: Never use ``==`` for comparing real numbers

   A list like ``x[0] == 1`` should never be used if ``x[0]`` is a real number,
   because rounding errors in ``x[0]`` may make the test fail even when it is
   mathematically correct. Consider
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           >>> 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
           False
           >>> 0.1 + 0.2
           0.30000000000000004
   
   Comparison of real numbers need to use tolerances! The values of the
   tolerances depend on the size of the numbers involved in arithmetic
   operations:
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           >>> abs(0.1+0.2 - 0.3)
           5.551115123125783e-17
           >>> abs(1.1+1.2 - 2.3)
           0.0
           >>> abs(10.1+10.2 - 20.3)
           3.552713678800501e-15
           >>> abs(100.1+100.2 - 200.3)
           0.0
           >>> abs(1000.1+1000.2 - 2000.3)
           2.2737367544323206e-13
           >>> abs(10000.1+10000.2 - 20000.3)
           3.637978807091713e-12
   
   For numbers around unity, tolerances as low as :math:`3\cdot 10^{-16}` can be used
   (in fact, this tolerance is known as ``DOLFIN_EPS`` in the ``dolfin`` package),
   otherwise an appropriate tolerance must be found.
   
   Testing for ``x[0] == 1`` should therefore be implemented as
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           tol = 1E-14
           if abs(x[0] - 1) < tol:
               ...




Here is a new boundary function using tolerances in the test:

.. code-block:: python

        def Dirichlet_boundary(x, on_boundary):
            tol = 1E-14   # tolerance for coordinate comparisons
            return on_boundary and \ 
                   (abs(x[0]) < tol or abs(x[0] - 1) < tol)

The second adjustment of our program concerns the definition of ``L``,
where we have to add a boundary integral and a definition of the :math:`g`
function to be integrated:

.. code-block:: python

        g = Expression('-4*x[1]')
        L = f*v*dx - g*v*ds

The ``ds`` variable implies a boundary integral, while ``dx``
implies an integral over the domain :math:`\Omega`.
No more modifications are necessary.

.. _tut:poisson:multiple:Dirichlet:

Multiple Dirichlet conditions
-----------------------------

The PDE problem from the previous section applies a function :math:`u_0(x,y)`
for setting Dirichlet conditions at two parts of the boundary.
Having a single function to set multiple Dirichlet conditions is
seldom possible. The more general case is to have :math:`m` functions for
setting Dirichlet conditions on :math:`m` parts of the boundary.
The purpose of this section is to explain how such multiple conditions
are treated in FEniCS programs.

Let us return to the case from the section :ref:`tut:poisson1:DN` and define
two separate functions for the two Dirichlet conditions:

.. math::
        
            - \nabla^2 u &= -6 \mbox{ in } \Omega, \\ 
            u &= u_L \mbox{ on } \Gamma_0, \\ 
            u &= u_R \mbox{ on } \Gamma_1, \\ 
            - {\partial u\over\partial n} &= g \mbox{ on } \Gamma_N {\thinspace .}
        

Here, :math:`\Gamma_0` is the boundary :math:`x=0`, while :math:`\Gamma_1` corresponds
to the boundary :math:`x=1`.  We have that :math:`u_L = 1 + 2y^2`, :math:`u_R = 2 +
2y^2`, and :math:`g=-4y`.

Functions for marking Dirichlet boundaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the left boundary :math:`\Gamma_0` we define the
usual triple of a function for the boundary value, a function for
defining the boundary of interest, and a ``DirichletBC`` object:

.. code-block:: python

        u_L = Expression('1 + 2*x[1]*x[1]')
        
        def left_boundary(x, on_boundary):
            tol = 1E-14   # tolerance for coordinate comparisons
            return on_boundary and abs(x[0]) < tol
        
        Gamma_0 = DirichletBC(V, u_L, left_boundary)

For the boundary :math:`x=1` we write a similar code snippet:

.. code-block:: python

        u_R = Expression('2 + 2*x[1]*x[1]')
        
        def right_boundary(x, on_boundary):
            tol = 1E-14   # tolerance for coordinate comparisons
            return on_boundary and abs(x[0] - 1) < tol
        
        Gamma_1 = DirichletBC(V, u_R, right_boundary)

The various essential conditions are then collected in a list
and used in the solution process:

.. code-block:: python

        bcs = [Gamma_0, Gamma_1]
        ...
        solve(a == L, u, bcs)
        # or
        problem = LinearVariationalProblem(a, L, u, bcs)
        solver  = LinearVariationalSolver(problem)
        solver.solve()

In other problems, where the :math:`u` values are constant at a part of the
boundary, we may use a simple ``Constant`` object instead of an
``Expression`` object.

Classes for marking Dirichlet boundaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of using a function like ``left_boundary(x, on_boundary)`` to
mark a boundary, we can alternatively use a class, which allows
for more flexibility in more complicated problems. The class for marking
a boundary is derived from class ``SubDomain`` and has a method ``inside(self, x, on_boundary)`` for the code that returns whether the ``point`` is on the
boundary in question or not. Our previous ``left_boundary`` function
takes this form in its class version:

.. code-block:: python

        class LeftBoundary(SubDomain):
            def inside(self, x, on_boundary):
                tol = 1E-14   # tolerance for coordinate comparisons
                return on_boundary and abs(x[0]) < tol
        
        left_boundary = LeftBoundary()
        Gamma_0 = DirichletBC(V, u_L, left_boundary)

Debugging Dirichlet conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Debugging of PDE solvers very often faces the question of whether the
boundary conditions are set correctly or not. To check which Dirichlet
conditions that are actually set in the present problem, we can call
the ``get_boundary_values`` method in the ``DirichletBC`` objects. This
method returns a dictionary with degrees of freedom as keys and
corresponding essential conditions as values. In the present problem
we can write

.. code-block:: python

        coor = mesh.coordinates()
        d2v = dof_to_vertex_map(V)
        for bc in bcs:
            bc_dict = bc.get_boundary_values()
            for dof in bc_dict:
                print('dof %2d: u=%g\t at point %s' %
                      (dof, bc_dict[dof],
        	      str(tuple(coor[d2v[dof]].tolist()))))

The printing of coordinates for each degree of freedom (node here)
is only appropriate when degrees of freedom coincide with function
values at the vertices of the mesh, which is the case for linear
Lagrange elements only. One should therefore make somewhat
more robust code that prints out the coordinates (for convenience
when checking boundary values) only in the case of first-order
Lagrange elements:

.. code-block:: python

        Lagrange_1st_order = V.ufl_element().degree() == 1
        if Lagrange_1st_order:
            coor = mesh.coordinates()
            d2v = dof_to_vertex_map(V)
            for bc in bcs:
                bc_dict = bc.get_boundary_values()
                for dof in bc_dict:
                    print('dof %2d: u=%g' % (dof, bc_dict[dof])),
                    print('\t at point %s' %
                          (str(tuple(coor[d2v[dof]].tolist()))))

The output for a mesh made by ``UnitSquareMesh(3, 2)`` becomes

.. code-block:: text

        dof  0: u=1 	 at point (0.0, 0.0)
        dof  8: u=3 	 at point (0.0, 1.0)
        dof  4: u=1.5 	 at point (0.0, 0.5)
        dof  3: u=2 	 at point (1.0, 0.0)
        dof 11: u=4 	 at point (1.0, 1.0)
        dof  7: u=2.5 	 at point (1.0, 0.5)

An extended example with multiple Neumann conditions would have
been quite natural now, but this requires marking various parts
of the boundary using the *mesh function* concept and is therefore
left to the section :ref:`tut:poisson:multi:bc`.

.. _tut:possion:2D:2mat:problem:

Working with two subdomains
---------------------------

.. index:: heterogeneous media

.. index:: multi-material domain

Solving PDEs in domains made up of different materials is a frequently
encountered task. In FEniCS, these kind of problems are handled by
defining subdomains inside the domain. The subdomains may represent the
various materials. We can thereafter define material properties through
functions, known in FEniCS as *mesh functions*,
that are piecewise constant in each subdomain.
A simple example with
two materials (subdomains) in 2D will
demonstrate the basic steps in the process.

.. Later, a multi-material

.. problem in :math:`d` space dimensions is addressed.

.. _tut:possion:2D:2mat:fig1:

.. figure:: layered_medium_2.png
   :width: 400

   *Medium with discontinuous material properties*

Mathematical problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose we want to solve

.. _Eq:tut:poisson:2D:2mat:varcoeff2:

.. math::

    \tag{37}
    \nabla\cdot \left\lbrack k(x,y)\nabla u(x,y)\right\rbrack = 0,
        

in a domain :math:`\Omega` consisting of two subdomains where :math:`k` takes on
a different value in each subdomain.
For simplicity, yet without loss of generality, we choose for the current
implementation
the domain :math:`\Omega = [0,1]\times [0,1]` and divide it into two equal
subdomains,
as depicted in Figure :ref:`tut:possion:2D:2mat:fig1`,

.. math::
        
        \Omega_0 = [0, 1]\times [0,1/2],\quad
        \Omega_1 = [0, 1]\times (1/2,1]{\thinspace .}
        

We define :math:`k(x,y)=k_0` in :math:`\Omega_0` and :math:`k(x,y)=k_1` in :math:`\Omega_1`,
where :math:`k_0>0` and :math:`k_1>0` are given constants.
As boundary conditions, we choose :math:`u=0` at :math:`y=0`, :math:`u=1` at :math:`y=1`,
and :math:`\partial u/\partial n=0` at :math:`x=0` and :math:`x=1`.
One can show that the exact solution is now given by

.. _Eq:_auto18:

.. math::

    \tag{38}
    u(x, y) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        {2yk_1\over k_0+k_1}, & y \leq 1/2\\ 
        {(2y-1)k_0 + k_1\over k_0+k_1}, & y \geq 1/2
        \end{array}\right.
        
        

As long as the element boundaries coincide with the internal boundary
:math:`y=1/2`, this piecewise linear solution should be exactly recovered
by Lagrange elements of any degree. We use this property to verify
the implementation.

Physically, the present problem may correspond to heat conduction, where
the heat conduction in :math:`\Omega_1` is more efficient than
in :math:`\Omega_0`. An alternative interpretation is flow in porous media
with two geological layers, where the layers' ability to transport
the fluid differs by a factor of 10.

.. index:: boundary specification (class)

.. _tut:possion:2D:2mat:impl:

Implementation          (3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new functionality in this subsection regards how to define the
subdomains :math:`\Omega_0` and :math:`\Omega_1`. For this purpose we need to use
subclasses of class ``SubDomain``, not only plain functions as we have
used so far for specifying boundaries. Consider the boundary function

.. code-block:: python

        def boundary(x, on_boundary):
            tol = 1E-14
            return on_boundary and abs(x[0]) < tol

for defining the boundary :math:`x=0`. Instead of using such a stand-alone
function, we can create an instance (or object)
of a subclass of ``SubDomain``,
which implements the ``inside`` method as an alternative to the
``boundary`` function:

.. code-block:: python

        class Boundary(SubDomain):
            def inside(self, x, on_boundary):
                tol = 1E-14
                return on_boundary and abs(x[0]) < tol
        
        boundary = Boundary()
        bc = DirichletBC(V, Constant(0), boundary)

A word about computer science terminology may be used here:
The term *instance*
means a Python object of a particular type (such as ``SubDomain``,
``Function``
``FunctionSpace``, etc.).
Many use *instance* and *object*
as interchangeable terms. In other computer programming languages one may
also use the term *variable* for the same thing.
We mostly use the well-known  term *object* in this text.

A subclass of ``SubDomain`` with an ``inside`` method offers
functionality for marking parts of the domain or
the boundary. Now we need to define one class for the
subdomain :math:`\Omega_0`
where :math:`y\leq 1/2` and another for the subdomain :math:`\Omega_1` where :math:`y\geq 1/2`:

.. code-block:: python

        tol = 1E-14  # Tolerance for coordinate comparisons
        
        class Omega0(SubDomain):
            def inside(self, x, on_boundary):
                return True if x[1] <= 0.5+tol else False
        
        class Omega1(SubDomain):
            def inside(self, x, on_boundary):
                return True if x[1] >= 0.5-tol else False

Notice the use of ``<=`` and ``>=`` in both tests. For a cell to
belong to, e.g., :math:`\Omega_1`, the ``inside`` method must return
``True`` for all the vertices ``x`` of the cell. So to make the
cells at the internal boundary :math:`y=1/2` belong to :math:`\Omega_1`, we need
the test ``x[1] >= 0.5``. However,
because of potential rounding errors in the coordinates ``x[1]``, we
use a tolerance in the comparisons: ``x[1] >= 0.5-tol``.

The next task is to use a ``MeshFunction`` to mark all
cells in :math:`\Omega_0` with the subdomain number 0 and all cells in :math:`\Omega_1`
with the subdomain number 1.
Our convention is to number subdomains as :math:`0,1,2,\ldots`.

A ``MeshFunction`` is a discrete function that can be evaluated at a set
of so-called *mesh entities*. Examples of mesh entities are
cells, facets, and vertices. A ``MeshFunction`` over cells is suitable to
represent subdomains (materials), while a ``MeshFunction`` over
facets is used to represent pieces of external or internal boundaries.
Mesh functions over vertices can be used to describe continuous fields.

Since we need to define subdomains of :math:`\Omega`
in the present example, we must make use
of a ``MeshFunction`` over cells. The
``MeshFunction`` constructor is fed with three arguments: 1) the type
of value: ``'int'`` for integers, ``'uint'`` for positive
(unsigned) integers, ``'double'`` for real numbers, and
``'bool'`` for logical values; 2) a ``Mesh`` object, and 3)
the topological dimension of the mesh entity in question: cells
have topological dimension equal to the number of space dimensions in
the PDE problem, and facets have one dimension lower.
Alternatively, the constructor can take just a filename
and initialize the ``MeshFunction`` from data in a file.

We start with creating a ``MeshFunction`` whose
values are non-negative integers (``'uint'``)
for numbering the subdomains.
The mesh entities of interest are the cells, which have dimension 2
in a two-dimensional problem (1 in 1D, 3 in 3D). The appropriate code for
defining the ``MeshFunction`` for two subdomains then reads

.. code-block:: python

        subdomains = MeshFunction('uint', mesh, 2)
        # Mark subdomains with numbers 0 and 1
        subdomain0 = Omega0()
        subdomain0.mark(subdomains, 0)
        subdomain1 = Omega1()
        subdomain1.mark(subdomains, 1)

Calling ``subdomains.array()`` returns a ``numpy`` array of the
subdomain values. That is, ``subdomain.array()[i]`` is
the subdomain value of cell number ``i``. This array is used to
look up the subdomain or material number of a specific element.

We need a function ``k`` that is constant in
each subdomain :math:`\Omega_0` and :math:`\Omega_1`. Since we want ``k``
to be a finite element function, it is natural to choose
a space of functions that is constant over each element.
The family of discontinuous Galerkin methods, in FEniCS
denoted by ``'DG'``, is suitable for this purpose. Since we
want functions that are piecewise constant, the value of
the degree parameter is zero:

.. code-block:: python

        V0 = FunctionSpace(mesh, 'DG', 0)
        k  = Function(V0)

To fill ``k`` with the right values in each element, we loop over
all cells (i.e., indices in ``subdomain.array()``),
extract the corresponding subdomain number of a cell,
and assign the corresponding :math:`k` value to the ``k.vector()`` array:

.. code-block:: python

        k_values = [1.5, 50]  # values of k in the two subdomains
        for cell_no in range(len(subdomains.array())):
            subdomain_no = subdomains.array()[cell_no]
            k.vector()[cell_no] = k_values[subdomain_no]

Long loops in Python are known to be slow, so for large meshes
it is preferable to avoid such loops and instead use *vectorized code*.
Normally this implies that the loop must be replaced by
calls to functions from the ``numpy`` library that operate on complete
arrays (in efficient C code). The functionality we want in the present
case is to compute an array of the same size as
``subdomain.array()``, but where the value ``i`` of an entry
in ``subdomain.array()`` is replaced by ``k_values[i]``.
Such an operation is carried out by the ``numpy`` function ``choose``:

.. code-block:: python

        help = numpy.asarray(subdomains.array(), dtype=numpy.int32)
        k.vector()[:] = numpy.choose(help, k_values)

The ``help`` array is required since ``choose`` cannot work with
``subdomain.array()`` because this array has elements of
type ``uint32``. We must therefore transform this array to an array
``help`` with standard ``int32`` integers.

Having the ``k`` function ready for finite element computations, we
can proceed in the normal manner with defining essential boundary
conditions, as in the section :ref:`tut:poisson:multiple:Dirichlet`,
and the :math:`a(u,v)` and :math:`L(v)` forms, as in
the section :ref:`tut:possion:2D:varcoeff`.

Multiple Neumann, Robin, and Dirichlet condition
------------------------------------------------

.. index:: Dirichlet boundary conditions

.. index:: Neumann boundary conditions

.. index:: Robin boundary conditions

.. index:: boundary conditions

Let us go back to the model problem from the section :ref:`tut:poisson:multiple:Dirichlet` where we had both Dirichlet and
Neumann conditions.  The term ``v*g*ds`` in the expression for ``L``
implies a boundary integral over the complete boundary, or in FEniCS
terms, an integral over all exterior facets.  However, the
contributions from the parts of the boundary where we have Dirichlet
conditions are erased when the linear system is modified by the
Dirichlet conditions.  We would like, from an efficiency point of
view, to integrate ``v*g*ds`` only over the parts of the boundary where
we actually have Neumann conditions.  And more importantly, in other
problems one may have different Neumann conditions or other conditions
like the Robin type condition.  With the mesh function concept we can
mark different parts of the boundary and integrate over specific
parts.  The same concept can also be used to treat multiple Dirichlet
conditions.  The forthcoming text illustrates how this is done.

Three types of boundary conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We extend our repertoire of boundary conditions to three types:
Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin.  Dirichlet conditions apply to some
parts :math:`\Gamma_{D,0}`, :math:`\Gamma_{D,1}`, :math:`...`, of the boundary:

.. math::
         u_{0,0}\hbox{ on }\Gamma_{D,0},\quad
        u_{0,1}\hbox{ on }\Gamma_{D,1}, \ldots

where :math:`u_{0,i}` are prescribed functions, :math:`i=0,1,\ldots`
On other parts, :math:`\Gamma_{N,0}`, :math:`\Gamma_{N,1}`, and so on, we have
Neumann conditions

.. math::
         -p{\partial u\over\partial n} = g_{0}\hbox{ on }\Gamma_{N,0},\quad
        -p{\partial u\over\partial n} = g_{1}\hbox{ on }\Gamma_{N,1},\quad \ldots
        

Finally, we have some parts :math:`\Gamma_{R,0}`, :math:`\Gamma_{R,1}`, and so forth,
with *Robin conditions*:

.. index:: Robin condition

.. _Eq:tut:poisson:multi:bc:Robin:

.. math::

    \tag{39}
    -p{\partial u\over\partial n} = r(u-s),
        
        

where :math:`r` and :math:`s` are specified functions.  The Robin condition is
most often used to model heat transfer to the surroundings and arise
naturally from Newton's cooling law. In that case, :math:`r` is a heat
transfer coefficient, and :math:`s` is the temperature of the
surroundings. Both can be space and time-dependent.

Model problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The model problem to be solved with multiple Dirichlet, Neumann, and
Robin conditions can formally be defined as

.. _Eq:tut:poisson:2D:DN3:

.. math::

    \tag{40}
    -\nabla\cdot(p\nabla u) = -f, \mbox{ in } \Omega, 
        

.. _Eq:tut:poisson:2D:DN3:bcD:

.. math::

    \tag{41}
    u = u_{0,i} \mbox{ on } \Gamma_{D,i},\quad i=0,1,\ldots
        
        

.. _Eq:tut:poisson:2D:DN3:bcN:

.. math::

    \tag{42}
    -p{\partial u\over\partial n} = g_i \mbox{ on } \Gamma_{N,i},\quad
        i=0,1,\ldots
        
        

.. _Eq:tut:poisson:2D:DN3:bcR:

.. math::

    \tag{43}
    -p{\partial u\over\partial n} = r_i(u-s_i) \mbox{ on } \Gamma_{R,i},\quad
        i=0,1,\ldots
        
        

Variational formulation          (3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integration by parts of :math:`-\int_\Omega v\nabla\cdot(p\nabla u) {\, \mathrm{d}x}` becomes
as usual

.. math::
        
         -\int_\Omega v\nabla\cdot(p\nabla u) {\, \mathrm{d}x}
        = \int_\Omega p\nabla u\cdot \nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x} -
        \int_{\partial\Omega}p\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}v {\, \mathrm{d}s}{\thinspace .}
        

The boundary integral does not apply to the parts of
the boundary where we have Dirichlet conditions (:math:`\Gamma_{D,i}`).
Moreover, on the remaining parts, we must split the boundary integral
into the parts where we have Neumann and Robin conditions such that we
insert the right conditions as integrands.
Specifically, we have

.. math::
        
        -\int_{\partial\Omega}p\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}v {\, \mathrm{d}s}
        =
        -\sum_i\int_{\Gamma_{N,i}}p\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} {\, \mathrm{d}s}
        -\sum_i\int_{\Gamma_{R,i}}p\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} {\, \mathrm{d}s}
        =
        \sum_i\int_{\Gamma_{N,i}}g_i {\, \mathrm{d}s}
        \sum_i\int_{\Gamma_{R,i}}r_i(u-s_i) {\, \mathrm{d}s}{\thinspace .}
        

The variational formulation then becomes

.. _Eq:tut:poisson:multi:bc:varform:

.. math::

    \tag{44}
    \int_{\Omega} p\nabla u\cdot \nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x} +
        \sum_i\int_{\Gamma_{N,i}} g_iv {\, \mathrm{d}s} + \int_{\Gamma_{R,i}}r_i(u-s_i)v {\, \mathrm{d}s}
        = \int_{\Omega} fv {\, \mathrm{d}x}{\thinspace .}
        
        

We want to write this variational formulation in the standard notation
:math:`a(u,v)=L(v)`, which requires that we identify all integrals with
*both* :math:`u` and :math:`v`, and collect these in :math:`a(u,v)`, while the remaining
integrals with :math:`v` and not :math:`u` go into :math:`L(v)`.  The integral from the
Robin condition must of this reason be split in two parts:

.. math::
        
        \int_{\Gamma_{R,i}}r_i(u-s_i)v {\, \mathrm{d}s}
        = \int_{\Gamma_{R,i}} r_iuv {\, \mathrm{d}s} - \int_{\Gamma_{R,i}}r_is_iv {\, \mathrm{d}s}{\thinspace .}
        

We then have

.. _Eq:tut:poisson:2D:DN3:var:a:

.. math::

    \tag{45}
    a(u, v) = \int_{\Omega} p\nabla u\cdot \nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x}
        + sum_i\int_{\Gamma_{R,i}}r_iuv {\, \mathrm{d}s},
        
        

.. _Eq:tut:poisson:2D:DN3:var:L:

.. math::

    \tag{46}
    L(v) = \int_{\Omega} fv {\, \mathrm{d}x} -
        sum_i\int_{\Gamma_{N,i}} g_i v {\, \mathrm{d}s} + \sum_i\int_{\Gamma_{R,i}}r_is_iv {\, \mathrm{d}s}{\thinspace .}
        
        

Implementation          (4)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Looking at our previous ``solver`` functions for solving the 2D Poisson equation,
the following new aspects must be taken care of:

 1. definition of a mesh function over the boundary,

 2. marking each side as a subdomain, using the mesh function,

 3. splitting a boundary integral into parts.

A general approach to the first task is to mark each of the four sides
of the square with markers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
To this end, we make use of the mesh function object, but contrary to
the section :ref:`tut:possion:2D:2mat:impl`, this is not a function over
cells, but a function over cell facets. We apply the ``FacetFunction``
for this purpose:

.. code-block:: python

        boundary_parts = FacetFunction('size_t', mesh)

As in the section :ref:`tut:possion:2D:2mat:impl` we use a subclass of
``SubDomain`` to identify the various parts of the mesh
function. Problems with domains of more complicated geometries may set
the mesh function for marking boundaries as part of the mesh
generation.  In our case, the :math:`x=0` boundary can be marked by

.. code-block:: python

        class BoundaryX0(SubDomain):
            def inside(self, x, on_boundary):
                return on_boundary and abs(x[0]) < tol
        
        bx0 = BoundaryX0()
        bx0.mark(boundary_parts, 0)

Similarly, we make the classes ``BoundaryX1`` for the :math:`x=1` boundary,
``BoundaryY0`` for the :math:`y=0` boundary, and ``BoundaryY1`` for the :math:`y=1`
boundary, and mark these as subdomains 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

For generality of the implementation, we let the user specify
what kind of boundary condition that applies to each of the four
boundaries. We set up a Python dictionary for this purpose, with
the key as subdomain number and the value as a dictionary specifying
the kind of condition as key and a function as its value.
For example,

.. code-block:: text

        boundary_conditions = {
          0: {'Dirichlet': u0},
          1: {'Robin': (r, s)},
          2: {'Neumann: g}},
          3: {'Neumann', 0}}

specifies

 * a Dirichlet condition, with values implemented by an ``Expression``
   or ``Constant`` object
   ``u0``, on subdomain 0, i.e., the :math:`x=1` boundary;

 * a Robin condition :ref:`(39) <Eq:tut:poisson:multi:bc:Robin>`
   on subdomain 1, :math:`x=1`, with ``Expression`` or ``Constant`` objects
   ``r`` and ``s`` specifying :math:`r` and :math:`s`;

 * a Neumann condition :math:`\partial u/\partial n=g` on subdomain 2, :math:`y=0`,
   where an ``Expression`` or ``Constant`` object ``g`` implements the value :math:`g`;

 * a homogeneous Neumann condition :math:`\partial u/\partial n=0` on
   subdomain 3, :math:`y=1`.

As explained in the section :ref:`tut:poisson:multiple:Dirichlet`,
multiple Dirichlet conditions must be collected in a list of
``DirichletBC`` objects. Based on the ``boundary_conditions`` data
structure above, we can construct this list by the following snippet:

.. code-block:: python

        bcs = []  # List of Dirichlet conditions
        for n in boundary_conditions:
            if 'Dirichlet' in boundary_conditions[n]:
                bcs.append(
                    DirichletBC(V, boundary_conditions[n]['Dirichlet'],
                                boundary_parts, n))

The new aspect of the variational problem is the two distinct
boundary integrals over :math:`\Gamma_{N,i}` and :math:`\Gamma_{R,i}`.
Having a mesh function over exterior cell facets (our
``boundary_parts`` object), where subdomains (boundary parts) are
numbered as :math:`0,1,2,\ldots`, the special symbol ``ds(0)``
implies integration over subdomain (part) 0, ``ds(1)`` denotes
integration over subdomain (part) 1, and so on.
The idea of multiple ``ds``-type objects generalizes to volume
integrals too: ``dx(0)``, ``dx(1)``, etc., are used to
integrate over subdomain 0, 1, etc.,  inside :math:`\Omega`.

Before we have ``ds(n)`` for integers ``n`` defined, we must do

.. code-block:: python

        ds = Measure('ds', domain=mesh, subdomain_data=boundaries_parts)

Similarly, if we want integration of different parts of the domain,
we redefine ``dx`` as

.. code-block:: python

        dx = Measure('dx', domain=mesh, subdomain_data=domains)

where ``domains`` is a ``CellFunction`` defining subdomains in :math:`\Omega`.

Suppose we have a Robin condition with values ``r`` and ``s`` on subdomain
``R``, a Neumann condition with value ``g`` on subdomain ``N``, the
variational form can be written

.. code-block:: python

        a = inner(nabla_grad(u), nabla_grad(v))*dx + r*u*v*ds(R)
        L = f*v*dx - g*v*ds(N) + r*s*v*ds(R)

In our case things get a bit more complicated since the
information about integrals in Neumann and Robin conditions
are in the ``boundary_conditions`` data structure. We can collect
all Neumann conditions by the code

.. code-block:: python

        u = TrialFunction(V)
        v = TestFunction(V)
        Neumann_integrals = []
        for n in boundary_conditions:
            if 'Neumann' in boundary_conditions[n]:
                if boundary_conditions[n]['Neumann'] != 0:
                    g = boundary_conditions[n]['Neumann']
                    Neumann_integrals.append(g*v*ds(n))

Applying ``sum(Nemann_integrals)`` will apply the ``+`` operator to
the variational forms in the ``Numeann_integrals`` list and result
in the integrals we need for the right-hand side ``L`` of the
variational form.

The integrals in the Robin condition can similarly be collected
in lists:

.. code-block:: python

        Robin_a_integrals = []
        Robin_L_integrals = []
        for n in boundary_conditions:
            if 'Robin' in boundary_conditions[n]:
                r, s = boundary_conditions[n]['Robin']
                Robin_a_integrals.append(r*u*v*ds(n))
                Robin_L_integrals.append(r*s*v*ds(n))

We are now in a position to define the ``a`` and ``L`` expressions
in the variational formulation:

.. code-block:: python

        a = inner(p*nabla_grad(u), nabla_grad(v))*dx + \ 
            sum(Robin_a_integrals)
        L = f*v*dx - sum(Neumann_integrals) + sum(Robin_L_integrals)

Simplified handling of the variational formulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We carefully ordered the terms in the variational formulation above
into the :math:`a` and :math:`L` parts. This requires a splitting of the Robin
condition and makes the ``a`` and ``L`` expressions less readable (still we
think understanding this splitting is key for any finite element programmer!).
Fortunately, UFL allow us to specify the complete variational form
:ref:`(44) <Eq:tut:poisson:multi:bc:varform>` as *one expression* and offer tools to
extract what goes into the bilinear form :math:`a(u,v)` and the linear form
:math:`L(v)`:

.. code-block:: python

        F = inner(p*nabla_grad(u), nabla_grad(v))*dx + \ 
            sum(Robin_integrals) - f*v*dx + sum(Neumann_integrals)
        a, L = lhs(F), rhs(F)

This time we can more naturally define the integrals from the
Robin condition as ``r*(u-s)*v*ds(n)``:

.. code-block:: python

        Robin_integrals = []
        for n in boundary_conditions:
            if 'Robin' in boundary_conditions[n]:
                r, s = boundary_conditions[n]['Robin']
                Robin_integrals.append(r*(u-s)*v*ds(n))

The complete code is in the ``solver_bc`` function in the
``p2D_vc.py`` file.

Test problem          (4)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us continue to use :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}=1+x^2+2y^2` as the exact solution, and
set :math:`p=1` and :math:`f=-6` in the PDE.  Our domain is the unit square, and
we assign Dirichlet conditions at :math:`x=0` and :math:`x=1`, a Neumann condition
at :math:`y=1`, and a Robin condition at :math:`y=0`. With the given :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}`, we
realize that the Neumann condition is :math:`-4y` (which means :math:`-4` at
:math:`y=1`), while the Robin
condition can be selected in many ways. Since :math:`\partial u/\partial
n=-\partial u/\partial y=0` at :math:`y=0`, we can select :math:`s=u` and have :math:`r`
arbitrary in the Robin condition.

The boundary parts are :math:`\Gamma_{D,0}`: :math:`x=0`, :math:`\Gamma_{D,1}`: :math:`x=1`,
:math:`\Gamma_{R,0}`: :math:`y=0`, and :math:`\Gamma_{N,0}`: :math:`y=1`.

When implementing this test problem (and especially other test problems
with more complicated expressions), it is advantageous to use
symbolic computing. Below we define :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}` as a ``sympy`` expression
and derive other functions from their mathematical definitions.
Then we turn these expressions into C/C++ code, which can be
fed into ``Expression`` objects.

This simple test problem is turned into a real unit test for different
function spaces in the function ``test_solver_bc``.

Debugging the setting of boundary conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is easy to make mistakes when implementing a problem with many
different types of boundary conditions, as in the present case. Some
helpful debugging output is to run through all vertex coordinates and
check if the ``SubDomain.inside`` method marks the vertex as on the
boundary. Another useful printout is to list which degrees of freedom
that are subject to Dirichlet conditions, and for first-order Lagrange
elements, add the corresponding vertex coordinate to the output.

.. code-block:: python

        if debug:
            # Print the vertices that are on the boundaries
            coor = mesh.coordinates()
            for x in coor:
                if bx0.inside(x, True): print('%s is on x=0' % x)
                if bx1.inside(x, True): print('%s is on x=1' % x)
                if by0.inside(x, True): print('%s is on y=0' % x)
                if by1.inside(x, True): print('%s is on y=1' % x)
            # Print the Dirichlet conditions
            print('No of Dirichlet conditions:', len(bcs))
            d2v = dof_to_vertex_map(V)
            for bc in bcs:
                bc_dict = bc.get_boundary_values()
                for dof in bc_dict:
                    print('dof %2d: u=%g' % (dof, bc_dict[dof]))
                    if V.ufl_element().degree() == 1:
                        print('   at point %s' %
                              (str(tuple(coor[d2v[dof]].tolist()))))

In addition, it is helpful to print the exact and the numerical solution
at all the vertices as shown in the section :ref:`tut:poisson1:verify1`.

Handy methods in key FEniCS objects
-----------------------------------

.. index:: pydoc

In general,
``pydoc dolfin.X`` shows the documentation of any DOLFIN name ``X``
and lists all the methods (i.e.g, functions in the class) that
can be called. Below, we list just a few, but very useful, methods
in the most central FEniCS classes.

Mesh
~~~~

Let ``mesh`` be a ``Mesh`` object.

  * ``mesh.coordinates()`` returns an array of the coordinates of
     the vertices in the mesh.

  * ``mesh.num_cells()`` returns the number of cells (triangles)
    in the mesh,

  * ``mesh.num_vertices()`` returns the number of vertices in
    the mesh (with our choice of linear Lagrange elements this equals the
    number of nodes, ``len(u_array)``, or dimension of the space ``V.dim()``),

  * ``mesh.cells()`` returns the vertex numbers of the vertices in
    each cell as a ``numpy`` array with shape
    (*number of cells*, *number of vertices in a cell*),

  * ``mesh.hmin()`` returns the minimum cell diameter ("smallest cell"),

  * ``mesh.hmax()`` returns the maximum cell diameter ("largest cell").

  * ``mesh.topology().dim()`` returns the number of physical dimensions of
    the mesh.

Writing ``print(mesh)`` dumps a short, pretty-print description
of the mesh (``print(mesh)`` actually displays the result of ``str(mesh)``,
which defines the pretty print):

.. code-block:: text

        <Mesh of topological dimension 2 (triangles) with
        16 vertices and 18 cells, ordered>

Function space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let ``V`` be a ``FunctionSpace`` object.

 * ``V.mesh()`` returns the associated mesh.

 * ``V.dim()`` returns the dimension (number of degrees of freedom).

 * ``V.ufl_element()`` returns the associated finite element.

Function
~~~~~~~~

Let ``u`` be a ``Function`` object.

 * ``u.function_space()`` returns the associated function space.

 * ``u.vector()`` returns the DOLFIN vector of degrees of freedom.

 * ``u.vector().array()`` returns a copy of the degrees of freedom
   in a ``numpy`` array.
