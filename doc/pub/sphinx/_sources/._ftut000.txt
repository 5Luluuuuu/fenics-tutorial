.. TITLE: Writing State-of-the-Art Finite Element Solvers in Minutes

.. Document title:

The FEniCS Tutorial
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

:Authors: Hans Petter Langtangen (hpl at simula.no), Anders Logg (logg at chalmers.se)

This book gives a concise and gentle introduction to finite element
programming in Python based on the popular FEniCS software library.
The library delivers high performance since FEniCS automatically
delegates compute-intensive tasks to C++ by help of code
generation. We show in detail how to write finite element solvers for
the Poisson equation, the time-dependent diffusion equation, the
equations of elasticity, and the Navier-Stokes equations, in heterogeneous
media and with different types of boundary conditions.

.. If a vol. 2, these comments are not so appropriate anymore:

.. After having digested the examples in this tutorial, it should be easy

.. to learn more from the more advanced FEniCS documentation and the

.. numerous demo programs that come with the software.
