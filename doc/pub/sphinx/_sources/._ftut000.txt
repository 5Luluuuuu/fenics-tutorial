The FEniCS Tutorial
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

:Authors: Hans Petter Langtangen (hpl at simula.no), Anders Logg (logg at chalmers.se)

This document presents a FEniCS tutorial to get new users quickly up
and running with solving differential equations. FEniCS can be
programmed both in C++ and Python, but this tutorial focuses
exclusively on Python programming, since this is the simplest approach
to exploring FEniCS for beginners and since it actually gives high
performance. After having digested the examples in this tutorial, the
reader should be able to learn more from the FEniCS documentation, the
numerous demo programs that come with the software,
and the comprehensive FEniCS book *Automated Solution of
Differential Equations by the Finite element Method*
[Ref01]_. This tutorial is a further development of the
opening chapter in [Ref01]_.
